<small>WASTE NOT, WANT NOT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Haroun-al-Raschid (of whom
I have told you before, and if I haven&#8217;t
it is only because I have forgotten) was having
a bath they wouldn&#8217;t let him splash. &#8220;By
the beard of Allah,&#8221; he observed mildly to
the Vizier, who was standing by with his
favourite celluloid duck (guaranteed to float),
&#8220;this is preposterous. Cannot the Commander
of the Faithful splash a little water?
What&#8217;s the good of being a King, that&#8217;s what
I say?&#8221; &#8220;Sire,&#8221; replied the Vizier, handing
him the celluloid duck, &#8220;the higher, the
fewer the pleasures of life. And remember
in season the saying, &#8216;Waste not, want not.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The following day torrential rains of unprecedented
severity visited Bagdad, sweeping
away houses and gardens and drowning,
among others, in circumstances of peculiar
discomfort, the Grand Vizier. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said
Haroun, splashing in his bath (and hitting
the opposite wall, mind you), &#8220;that only
shows.&#8221;</p>

<small>LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A
HAYSTACK</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MR. ARTHUR BENACRES&mdash;the
celebrated philanthropist&mdash;suffered in
private life the inconvenience of being an
ostrich. This was due to the act of a rather
deaf fairy friend of the family, who mistook
an observation on the weather (addressed to
him by a conversational curate at the christening)
for a request for feathers.</p>

<p>This, as you suppose, caused Mr. Benacres
some difficulty, and led him to consider
methods of escape. For though it was agreeable
to be able to subsist on odd scraps of
broken rubbish, and to dig with his head
(instead of a spade) in the nice clean sand,
people did make a fuss on the Underground
and at parties.</p>

<p>Till at last another fairy friend of the
family, who was neither deaf or blind, said:
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go into Parliament? Then
nobody will notice.&#8221; And they didn&#8217;t.</p>

<small>ALL&#8217;S WELL THAT ENDS WELL</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONCE upon a time there was a princess
whose mother would not buy her an
umbrella. This was due to the wicked incompetence
of the Prime Minister of that
country, who, having no children of his own,
spent all his money on swords instead of
umbrellas. (Yes, I know swords are nicer
generally, but these weren&#8217;t; besides they
were two-edged.) Moreover, her mother
went and bought her a most unbecoming
mackintosh&mdash;the sort that cuts your chin.
And so, as it was raining all the time (for this
princess lived at Kilcreggan in Dumbartonshire),
she asked to be turned into a frog or
a toad, because they didn&#8217;t need umbrellas,
and their mackintoshes fit at the neck.</p>

<p>Well, she was, and then she found that
being a frog she couldn&#8217;t use her scooter, or
read &#8220;Antony and Cleopatra&#8221; to her mother,
or go into Kensington Gardens with her
father. (No! Kensington Gardens isn&#8217;t at
Kilcreggan, but this is a fairy princess, and
so it doesn&#8217;t matter.) So she unwished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
herself, and she was a princess, and she had
no umbrella and a mackintosh that didn&#8217;t
fit at the neck. But it was a drought.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> So all&#8217;s
well that ends well.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<small>FAINT HEART NEVER WON FAIR
LADY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MISS JUNE MORTIFEX was most
beautiful&mdash;yes, and more beautiful
than that. So that when she looked out of
the window the Meteorological Department
in Exhibition Road, Kensington, over the
Post Office, said: &#8220;The westerly depression
over London is now moving rapidly northward
with a southern twist,&#8221; which means
nothing, and only shows how excited they
all were.</p>

<p>But on account of her very exceptional
beauty everybody was afraid of marrying
her because they said &#8220;She would cost a
King&#8217;s Hansom,&#8221; and owing to the increase
in the number of motor taxicabs nobody
had one about them.</p>

<p>So one day she blacked her face and
assuming a Mid-Victorian Cockney accent
went down Piccadilly singing the well-known
ditty:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;O Mr. Jansen,</div>
<div class="verse">You kissed me in the hansom,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Ansom is as &#8217;ansom does,</div>
<div class="verse">Now you push me off the bus.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>As may be supposed, this remarkable revival
aroused the interest of a distinguished
literary critic, who, recognising merit, even
under an unpromising exterior, offered his
hand, shortly after followed by his heart.
&#8220;But, Edward,&#8221; whispered June, &#8220;I am
not what I seem.&#8221; &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t be,&#8221;
he answered triumphantly, &#8220;the Victorians
never were.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he walked into St. George&#8217;s,
Hanover Square, and ordered three of the
best banns they had. And he gave her as a
bridal gift the collected works of Mr. Edmund
Gosse, for he was not faint-hearted.</p>

<small>TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT&#8217;S no good pretending that Petronella
Gibbs was a good princess. For one thing,
she was always asking questions. And if the
nurses didn&#8217;t know the answer they were
instantly beheaded. With the result that there
was an unprecedented shortage in the supply
of domestic labour. The Queen, her mother,
indeed remarked to a friend of hers, another
Queen living in the palace opposite, that
&#8220;she never.&#8221; You may suppose therefore
that things had reached a crisis.</p>

<p>But did Petronella care? She did not care.
She could do without nurses, thank you. On
the contrary, she decided to start answering
questions. For instance. For a long time all
the best people had wanted to know &#8220;Who&#8217;s
Who.&#8221; And a very large and important book
had been written about it. Petronella wrote
as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Deer Editter.</div>
<div class="indent3">Nobody is.</div>
<div class="indent6">Yours evva,</div>
<div class="indent9">Petronella P.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>This, which was the obvious solution, created
considerable consternation. The Queen&mdash;her
mother&mdash;had a long consultation with
the King&mdash;her father&mdash;on his return from
the Royal Exchange, where he kept his bulls,
bears and hyenas, and remarked, &#8220;I never.&#8221;
But the King only laughed. That is why so
many women are Republicans.</p>

<p>At last Petronella became so celebrated
that the King of America, colloquially known
as the President of the United States, asked
for her hand in marriage. He and his subjects
had been guessing so long that they
thought that the time had come to find someone
who knew.</p>

<p>The flattering offer was accepted by her
royal parents, and Petronella, with great
pomp and ceremony, embarked. Upon her
arrival she was met by the leading citizens,
who asked her, &#8220;What do you think of
America?&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; she replied, which
was the right answer. At which they, being
accustomed to the latter, and never previously
having met the former, exclaimed, &#8220;Truth
is stranger than fiction,&#8221; and adding, &#8220;not
half so true either,&#8221; asked her with tears in
their eyes to return where they asserted she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
belonged. Which she did. And both she
and the King of America lived happily ever
after.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Arthur Nobbs was a little boy
he believed in fairies. If, for example,
he ate part of his sister&#8217;s jam (as he constantly
did), he assured her that the fairies would put
it back. And if they didn&#8217;t, well that was because
she didn&#8217;t believe in them.</p>

<p>When he grew older and became a business
man he naturally continued to entertain that
belief. When he was successful (as he generally
was) in his business transactions, he
ascribed his success to the fairies, though the
persons he so continuously and cleverly
ruined thought that he had got the name
wrong.</p>

<p>One day he met a starving sculptor whose
father he had been able to put out of business.
&#8220;What are these horrible objects that you
have in your tray?&#8221; he asked severely.
&#8220;These,&#8221; said the sculptor, &#8220;are the seven
fairies in which you believe.&#8221; &#8220;But,&#8221; objected
Mr. Nobbs, &#8220;they are labelled &#8216;The
Seven Deadly Sins,&#8217; and they look it.&#8221; &#8220;Oh,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
said the sculptor, &#8220;the title is only a matter
of taste.&#8221; &#8220;You are an impostor, sir,&#8221; exclaimed
Mr. Nobbs; &#8220;but fortunately we
are in a law-abiding country.&#8221; And he gave
the young man in charge for seeking to obtain
money by false pretences.</p>

<p>But you will be glad to learn that Arthur
Nobbs was subsequently raised to the peerage
and died universally beloved and respected,
and on his tombstone they carved
the simple phrase:</p>



<p class="center">&#8220;He believed in fairies.&#8221;</p>

<small>A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS A
DANGEROUS THING</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE father of Miss Liddell was favourably
known to the general public as
the man who had written to the public prints
during a strike a bold letter beginning: &#8220;Sir,&mdash;Let
all strikers be shot. Then let ...&#8221;
and again during a lock-out an equally bold
letter with the following introduction: &#8220;Sir,&mdash;Let
all employers be shot. Then let ...&#8221;
(It is believed that it is from this use of &#8220;let&#8221;
in public correspondence that the word
&#8220;letter&#8221; is derived.)</p>

<p>Miss Liddell, therefore, naturally objected
to the fact that the Prince, over whose education
she presided, disliked the manly game
of football. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know,&#8221; she would
say from time to time, &#8220;what Wellington
said about the playing fields of Eton?&#8221;
&#8220;No,&#8221; the Prince used to reply, &#8220;who was
Wellington? One of those professional footballers
one reads about in their newspapers?&#8221;
&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; Miss Liddell was wont to
reply. &#8220;He was a great general who beat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
French.&#8221; &#8220;What did he do that for?&#8221; the
Prince would ask. &#8220;Because they were his
country&#8217;s enemies.&#8221; &#8220;Ah!&#8221; the Prince
would say, &#8220;but I thought the French were
England&#8217;s friends.&#8221; &#8220;So they are now,&#8221;
Miss Liddell would say. &#8220;And did Wellington
beat them because of football?&#8221; the
Prince would inquire. &#8220;Wellington said
so,&#8221; Miss Liddell (slightly flushed) would
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you give me my paint-box?&#8221; the
Prince would murmur politely.</p>

<small>TWO WRONGS DO NOT MAKE
A RIGHT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">LISTEN. This is quite a new story.
It is about a swan that wished he was
an ugly duckling again. He was one of those
two swans who stand at the edge of the Round
Pond, have black feet and holes to put tape
through in their beaks. Only they won&#8217;t let
you put tape through.</p>

<p>What he said was (quite simply), &#8220;Liberty,
Equality and Fraternity.&#8221; To which his mate
said, &#8220;Then why do you always eat more
than your share?&#8221; But the other swan was
an idealist and took no notice.</p>

<p>He summoned a public meeting of the
ducks after closing-time, and having elected
himself to the chair after rather a protracted
argument with a pertinacious old drake, told
his audience that he was a duck at heart.
&#8220;What is beauty,&#8221; he went on to say, &#8220;that
it should put one on a lonely eminence. The
exquisite shape of the swan, his girl-like neck,
what right to rule do these confer?&#8221; &#8220;None,&#8221;
said the old drake, heartily. &#8220;Did you say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
beauty?&#8221; said a young female duck, bridling
her feathers. &#8220;Why you poor old antic, if
you knew how we ducks sympathised with
you on your deformity!&#8221;</p>

<p>But this was a little too much for the swan.
&#8220;I did not come here to be insulted,&#8221; he
said hotly, &#8220;by a brood of blasphemous
pond-puddlers. Are you aware that the Great
Swan made swans in his image?&#8221; &#8220;And
are you aware,&#8221; said the old drake, &#8220;that the
swans retorted by making him in theirs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said his mate to the rather
draggled swan who returned about midnight,
&#8220;how did you get on?&#8221; &#8220;Get on,&#8221;
he screamed, &#8220;those ducks think that equality
means that I&#8217;m equal with them.&#8221; &#8220;And
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; &#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; said the swan,
tucking his head under his wings, &#8220;it means
that they&#8217;re equal with me.&#8221; &#8220;And what&#8217;s
more,&#8221; he said with sudden truculence as
he emerged for a moment, &#8220;a swan&#8217;s a swan
for a&#8217; that.&#8221;</p>

<small>BUSINESS IS BUSINESS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE electric bell had rung for the fourth
time, when the door was opened by an
agreeable young man dressed in the height
of fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he inquired in the
amiable tone of one who begins an interesting
conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the Milk,&#8221; retorted the young man
with the cans a little shortly, for he was not
pleased at being so long delayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you not come in one moment?&#8221;
the young householder retorted. &#8220;I have
within the butcher, the grocer and the baker,
and I have long desired to add you to the list
of my visitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young milkman (still carrying his
heavy can) followed the polite young gentleman
into a fine, lofty room. The whole was
arranged with exquisite taste, and many deep
rugs indicated a luxurious vein in the young
man&#8217;s character. At the further end of the
room, arranged neatly in an isosceles triangle
(for the baker was much shorter than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
other two), were the corpses of the butcher,
the baker, and the grocer.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I inquire,&#8221; said the Milk, after
surveying the scene in silence for a minute,
&#8220;why you have killed these three gentlemen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the best of rights in the world
to ask, and I shall be delighted to explain,&#8221;
answered the young gentleman courteously.
&#8220;You must know, then, that I have a speculative
interest in the manner in which the
smaller British tradesman meets death. I
have been much charmed by the experience
I have gleaned with the help of my three
friends there. The butcher,&#8221; he added,
pointing smilingly to a discolouration on his
forehead, &#8220;was the least graceful. And now
as I have answered you, perhaps you will
allow me to ask you a question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But pray do,&#8221; answered the Milk, not to
be outdone in courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you. I was going to inquire
whether you knew any reason why I should
not add you to my list.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I apprehended,&#8221; returned the Milk,
&#8220;that your question might be something of
that sort. I had gone so far as to prepare an
answering question.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&#8220;And what might that be?&#8221; inquired
the young gentleman?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I not kill you?&#8221; retorted
the Milk affably.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something in what you say,&#8221;
exclaimed the young gentleman. &#8220;I had not
considered the question. Will you give me a
minute or two to meditate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be about my business, I am afraid,&#8221;
returned the Milk, quietly bludgeoning the
young man as he spoke with his milk can.
&#8220;Yet how sad it is,&#8221; he said reflectively surveying
the four corpses, &#8220;that speculation
must inevitably make way for practical affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he proceeded to replace the
milk he had spilled with water from a neighbouring
table.</p>

<small>IT&#8217;S NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NORTH of SkelleffteÃ¥, in the kingdom
of Sweden, there lived a more than
usually repulsive troll, who was, however,
the supreme Scandinavian authority on
psycho-analysis. The pine-trees in that part
of the world walk down to the water of the
sea as though the weight of their own beauty
had become too heavy for them. And the
sea with blandishing whispers holds out to
them the immense temptation of his cold
peace.</p>

<p>On a rock at the rendezvous of sea and
pines, under a midnight-sun-haunted sky
of June, the troll sat with huge horn glasses
on his twisted nose relentlessly reading the
work which Mr. Freud was to write some
centuries later....</p>

<p>Out of the shadows of the pine, as straight,
as serious, and weighed down like them with
the burden of her own loveliness, slipped the
Princess Gurli on her way to the cold temptation
of the sea. Like other princesses before
and after, she was enchanted. When she looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
at her almost flawless loveliness in the lily-pond
of her father&#8217;s castle, she saw always a
faint silver mist that trembled at her mirrored
lips. The mist would draw together into a
frangible bubble, a diaphanous ball of silver,
and finally dissolve, leaving an infinite argent
stain on the red of her mouth.</p>

<p>One day a fish had swum up from the
marble floor, and rising to the surface, had
said to her, &#8220;What will you give me if I
drink the mist?&#8221; And she had answered,
&#8220;What do you wish?&#8221; &#8220;Your soul,&#8221; he
replied. This she was glad in any case to be
rid of, for her soul had often interfered with
the natural pleasures to which she was entitled
by her loveliness.</p>

<p>The fish and the mist disappeared together,
and for the first time she saw herself
in flawless loveliness. But she was strangely
cold.</p>

<p>Princes came to her from the North and
the South, but when they looked into the
green stain of her eyes they shivered and
turned away. The Princess was not sorry,
for she thought that men were a poor substitute
for her own beauty. But with her
twenty-first summer she was conscious that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
her beauty was threatened. For a neighbouring
queen had been heard to say of her,
&#8220;Yes, she is lovely. But for me her beauty
has no soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>Therefore she decided to marry a prince
of her own choice, who would ask all of her
and nothing, whose castle has no lamps and
whose palace gardens are visited neither by
sun nor snow.</p>

<p>It was on her way to this alliance that she
slipped out of the pines, and beheld on the
rock under the midnight-sun-haunted sky the
unusually repulsive troll reading the prenatal
works of Mr. Freud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha,&#8221; neighed the troll, looking up, &#8220;you
have come to consult me, Princess Gurli.&#8221;
&#8220;I have not,&#8221; said the Princess. &#8220;I do not
like trolls.&#8221; &#8220;But I,&#8221; said the troll, &#8220;am not
like other trolls.&#8221; &#8220;That is what all trolls
say,&#8221; replied the Princess scornfully. &#8220;Perhaps,&#8221;
said the troll, &#8220;but I am the greatest
Scandinavian authority on psycho-analysis!&#8221;
&#8220;What in Valhalla,&#8221; said the Princess, &#8220;is
that?&#8221; &#8220;The study of souls,&#8221; cried the troll
with a significant chuckle. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the
Princess, &#8220;you can&#8217;t study mine. I haven&#8217;t
got one.&#8221; &#8220;This is interesting,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
troll; &#8220;you are undoubtedly suffering from
an advanced condition of mermaid-complex.&#8221;
&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; said the Princess.
&#8220;It means that you have a suppressed passion
for a Mer-King,&#8221; replied the troll, &#8220;and if
you give way to it you will be cured immediately.&#8221;
&#8220;I have never heard anything so disgusting,&#8221;
said the Princess. &#8220;Why, a Mer-King
is half a fish.&#8221; &#8220;Half a fish,&#8221; said the
troll sententiously, &#8220;is better than no fish.&#8221;
&#8220;I had meant,&#8221; said the Princess, &#8220;to drown
myself in the sea because the loss of my soul
troubled me. But now that I know that souls
are things that can be studied by creatures
like you, I am very glad I have not got one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The troll was so shocked at this outburst
that he fell backwards into the sea, where he
was instantly seized by mermaids and drowned.
But the Princess went back, slim and gold,
through the shadow of the pines, and married
the youngest son of the nearest fishmonger.</p>

<small>ARS LONGA, VITA BREVIS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AT about half-past eleven on a summer
evening there might have been observed,
wending her way slowly along the
Rue du Soleil Levant into the Cour de St.
Pierre at Geneva, a small black kitten with
her tail straight up. There was nobody in the
cobbled square except the beech-tree in the
middle with a wooden seat round him. The
kitten, who was being brought up on a severely
anti-religious basis, doubted whether the tree
might not have been influenced by the
cathedral window, in whose shadow he had
dreamed summer and winter for more than a
hundred years. She was therefore on the
point of slipping into a most engaging gutter
of stone, like a deep mouse-track, that leads
past the chapel of Calvin to the railings that
overlook the Passage des DegrÃ©s des Poules.</p>

<p>But the beech wasn&#8217;t going to stand that.
On the contrary! He dropped one little fidgety
brown leaf&mdash;puff!&mdash;between the kitten&#8217;s
paws, who, throwing religious prejudice to
the winds, played with it as enchantingly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
though it had been a convert to Epistemological
Radicalism.</p>

<p>Then the moon looked over the crooked
gables into the square, and proceeded to light
her cold lamp in all the dark cathedral
windows. But the beech rustled her leaves
warningly at her. &#8220;What is it?&#8221; said the
moon, and then she saw the little black kitten
dancing with the leaf on the cobbles. &#8220;Who
is your little black faun of a friend?&#8221; she
inquired of the beech. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know her
name,&#8221; said the beech, &#8220;but she certainly
dances extremely well.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point the kitten stopped abruptly
and said a little harshly, &#8220;What are you
two old ones whispering about?&#8221; &#8220;We
were remembering,&#8221; said the beech, who
was a kindly old fellow, &#8220;the time when we
also danced with our shadows in the joy of
our youth.&#8221; &#8220;How can that be?&#8221; said the
kitten impatiently. &#8220;The moon never was
young, and you never had but one leg, and
that stuck in the ground. You are telling me
fairy tales, and I have no patience with them.
Let me tell you my dancing is merely automatic
muscular reaction.&#8221; &#8220;Dear me,&#8221; said
the moon mildly, &#8220;what long words that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
child uses! But tell me, little one, if you don&#8217;t
like fairy tales, you won&#8217;t want to hear the
story of the cat and the fiddle.&#8221; &#8220;Does it
observe the dramatic unities?&#8221; inquired the
kitten. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what they are,&#8221; said
the moon, &#8220;but it has a moral.&#8221; &#8220;Which is
more than you have, you little wretch,&#8221; said
the beech severely. &#8220;Oh well,&#8221; said the kitten
ungraciously, &#8220;I suppose I must hear it,
though I expect that it will be representational.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once upon a time,&#8221; said the moon,
&#8220;there was a cat that had the soul of a
musician. But when she tried to render her
thoughts into sound she excited no sympathetic
response. On the contrary, people
threw boots and bottles at her. &#8216;I do not
care,&#8217; said the cat, &#8216;my songs are for posterity.&#8217;
But nevertheless the constant succession of
missiles disturbed her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my considered opinion,&#8221; interrupted
the kitten, &#8220;that she was no artist. The best
art rejects appreciation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So the dog said,&#8221; observed the moon,
&#8220;when he was chasing the cat up the tree
with yells of derision. But the cat was not
comforted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8220;Finally one day as she wandered disconsolate
through a field she met a very tragic
cow lowing, as it seemed to the cat, with a
mild haunting beauty. When she came up
with the cow the cat observed that her eyes
were streaming with tears. &#8216;How is it,&#8217; said
the cat, &#8216;that you who are notoriously as
unmusical as a milk-can can low with a beauty
that brings tears to your own eyes.&#8217; &#8216;It is
not my music that brings tears to my eyes,
but my lost calf. And let me tell you, cat,
that till you also play on the strings of your
own heart you will never make music.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is very affecting,&#8221; said the beech-tree;
&#8220;and very untrue,&#8221; added the kitten.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cat resolved this dark saying till one
day she heard in the dining-room the delicate
symphony of a spoon upon a china plate.
Presently the sound ceased and the cat jumped
upon the table to investigate. &#8216;How is it,&#8217;
said she to the empty dish, &#8216;that you make
such exquisite music though you are nothing
but baked clay?&#8217; &#8216;It is the loss of the beautiful
jelly that adorned me that sings,&#8217; said
the dish, &#8216;and let me tell you, cat, that till
you also play upon the strings of your own
heart you will never make music.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;This is very strange,&#8217; thought the cat,
but she continued nevertheless to sing as
before without sympathetic response. Till at
last an angry old gentleman obtained a gun
and shot the cat dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This story is in very bad taste,&#8221; said the
kitten.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she richly deserved it,&#8221; said the
beech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said the moon, &#8220;the
story is not finished. An old poor maker of
fiddle-strings found the cat on his way home.
And about a month later a young fiddler of
the country called upon him to buy some
strings. &#8216;These are the best I have ever
made,&#8217; said the old man. That night,&#8221; went
on the moon, &#8220;the fiddler played under a
window of a high house in the Place de la
Taconnerie an old German tune, &#8216;Einst o
wunder.&#8217; And now no one threw boots and
missiles, but out of a high lattice fell a white
rose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a very beautiful story,&#8221; said the
beech, &#8220;and now I am almost sorry for the
cat.&#8221; &#8220;You need not be,&#8221; said the moon;
&#8220;even if her life was short her art&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;was
in the right place,&#8221; rudely interjected the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
impertinent kitten. &#8220;But what I want to
know is, who shot the fiddler?&#8221; &#8220;I am
afraid,&#8221; replied the moon, &#8220;that I must be
going about my business.&#8221;</p>

that I shall publish the book at all if it&#8217;s about
Swedish trolls and Genevese cats. Couldn&#8217;t
you write about something British&mdash;a gnome
who made 94 not out for Surrey and then
went home and drank a bottle of stout?&#8221;
&#8220;I not only can,&#8221; said the author, &#8220;but I
immediately will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was once,&#8221; said the author, &#8220;a
sprite who thought goloshes and hot water
bottles unmanly. He preferred east winds
and colds in the head, and being strong and
silent (though he sneezed a good deal from
time to time), and though he was a pagan
himself, he could respect Christianity in
others. His name was Puck; he lived at
Bexhill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been expecting this for some time,&#8221;
broke in the publisher; &#8220;all you do is to
take other people&#8217;s noble conceptions and distort
them. Disguising plagiarism as travesty,
you seek to impose on the public. But let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
tell you, sir, in the words of the Latin poet,
&#8216;Sunt certi denique fines.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to have given offence,&#8221; said
the author, &#8220;particularly as I would have
wished to sketch a new version of Puck&#8217;s life,
when as a result of continued exposure to
draughts in what the Americans taught him
to call God&#8217;s Great Out-at-Elbows he contracted
a vivid form of rheumatism. So
crippled, he devoted his declining years to
Worthing and the pleasures of a bath chair.
Not unnaturally in these circumstances he
developed a horror of Sussex and of children,
and found his only remaining happiness in
reading the poems of Mr. Edward Shanks
to the local clergy. When he died, as he did
shortly after this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only surprised,&#8221; interrupted the
publisher bitterly, &#8220;that the clergy survived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the author, &#8220;they did not survive
long. It is true that their counsel at the
trial urged that it was justifiable homicide
in self-defence, but the judge quite properly
pointed out in his summing-up that they
needn&#8217;t have listened. But I can see,&#8221; went
on the author, &#8220;that this is not the sort of
story of which you were in need. Let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
therefore recount to you the true story of
Jack and the Beanstalk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that it is not very long,&#8221; said the
publisher.</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends on the method of payment,&#8221;
replied the author. &#8220;If I am paid by
the word, of course&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get on with the story,&#8221; said the publisher.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the side of a slow river in the western
parts of a great metropolis there lived a boy
named Jack. Though he was so young he
was already justly celebrated for his climbing
feats. Indeed, the old woman who looked
after him was never tired of saying, with a
roguish smile at herself in the mirror, &#8216;C&#8217;est
un vrai gosse!&#8217; which means in English, &#8216;He
takes after his spiritual grandmother.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack had climbed all the trees in his own
garden and all those in everybody else&#8217;s.
And then one day he announced that he was
going to climb an entirely new tree whose
roots are in the heart but whose leaves are
in eternity.... There was much discussion
among his friends, some saying that he should
climb and others that he shouldn&#8217;t, and still
others (but these were jealous) that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
little better than an Indian rope trick. But
Jack was not to be deterred. For he said that
he was tired of living among pygmies; he
would now climb the Immortal Tree and slay
one of the giants and return with his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That night accordingly the tree was
planted, and by morning its leaves hid the
sky. After a farewell breakfast, at which a
good deal of stout was drunk, and at which
the Press was well represented, Jack started
the ascent. He climbed up and up till he was
out of sight. His friends waited about till
nightfall, but as he did not return they concluded
that he was making a night of it with
the giants, and went home to their evening
porter and bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next morning the tree was withered. Some
said one thing and some said another. These,
that the giants had insisted on Jack&#8217;s remaining
among them, and these (but these were
traducers), that he had fallen to the first giant.
The general view, however, was that Jack
had burst with chagrin on discovering that,
except for himself, there were no giants. But
since his departure nobody has ever climbed
the beanstalk, for, as they all said, &#8216;Sunt
certi denique fines.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>&#8220;That story,&#8221; said the publisher, &#8220;is
worse than the first. That was vulgar, but this
has no meaning whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You just publish it and see,&#8221; said the
author.</p>

<small>HEAVEN HELPS THOSE THAT
HELP THEMSELVES</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the great days of Haroun-al-Raschid,
when the minarets of Bagdad were sewn
together against the sky like a gold embroidery
on blue canvas, a certain merchant, whose
name has unhappily not been preserved,
was entering at nightfall with his camels and
his asses through the Gold East Gate. The
beggars, as was their custom, crowded round
with shrill cries, extolling the merchant&#8217;s
virtues and their own miseries, and suggesting
that the former might reasonably be
expected to mitigate the latter. &#8220;In the name
of the All-Compassionate, the All-Merciful,&#8221;
they murmured musically. But the merchant
only wrapped his cloak round him closer,
saying in a harsh voice, &#8220;Heaven helps those
that help themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment one of the merchant&#8217;s
asses stumbled and beautiful red coins ran
in the gutters under the pale yellow moon.
With cries even more musical the beggars&mdash;not
excluding those lame by profession&mdash;threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
themselves upon the gold. &#8220;Sons of
Shaitan,&#8221; roared the merchant, &#8220;I will
have you all strung up to the city gates by
your toes and ears. I will have you flayed
with red pepper. I will&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surprise me, oh merchant,&#8221; said a
poet who had been a witness of the whole
scene. &#8220;Is it no longer your view then that
heaven helps those that help themselves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you not see,&#8221; screamed the merchant,
&#8220;that it is an ass that helps them?&#8221; &#8220;Does
that surprise you,&#8221; inquired the poet, going
on his way, &#8220;I gather from your appearance
of wealth that heaven has already helped
you.&#8221;</p>

<small>&#8220;YOU NEVER CAN TELL&#8221;</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THIS is a story for patriots,&#8221; said
the pin of the unexploded hand-grenade
to the poppies among which he was
rusting.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is a patriot?&#8221; asked the youngest
of the poppies, who, I am afraid, was rather
an affected puss and thought that the pin
was in love with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;A patriot,&#8221; said the pin, &#8220;is a man who
loves his country so well that he dies for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would show his affection better to
my mind,&#8221; said a rather withered female
poppy, &#8220;if he lived for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; simpered the young poppy, &#8220;I
think that death is so romantic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How adorable,&#8221; sighed the hand-grenade,
&#8220;are the enthusiasms of youth. I remember
exactly the same innocent thrill when some
five years ago I reposed among a pile of
grenades like myself all going into action.
We were doomed, we knew, to burst. But
what did that matter? Our country called
us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>&#8220;What country was that?&#8221; inquired one
of the poppies.</p>

<p>&#8220;England,&#8221; said the grenade proudly.
&#8220;Bow, poppies, you are in the presence of a
British bomb! It is true, of course, that my
iron was dug in Spain, that my copper came
from the New World, and that my explosives
were in part foreign. But I was as pure British
as anybody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you were,&#8221; said the young poppy
consolingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we came to the trench,&#8221; continued
the pin, &#8220;we were assigned each to a bomb-thrower.
I myself fell to the lot of a young
man beautiful as an angel and reckless as
a devil. Grenade after grenade he tossed
into the air with exquisite dexterity, and the
frightful explosions and horrible cries that
followed showed only too well how richly
his skill had been rewarded. And now my
great moment was at hand. An attack was
ordered. Over the parapet he leapt clasping
me in his hand, and together we flew through
the flying and screaming death about us.
We reached the enemy trench. The loathsome
horrors were actually attempting to
shoot down our brave fellows. I am happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to say that the bayonet taught them better.
But alas! I now come to the most awful
moment in my life. We jumped into the
trench. My hero raised his hand to throw
me at one of the incarnate devils. And then&mdash;his
hand dropped. &#8216;Carl,&#8217; he whispered,
&#8216;is it you, Carl?&#8217; This, mind you, to an
incarnate devil. &#8216;George,&#8217; he replied, and
though he was a devil, I confess his voice
made me uneasy, &#8216;has it come to this, dear
brother? Throw the grenade. It will be better
so. There can be no hell as foul as this.&#8217;
&#8216;What, murder you?&#8217; cried my ex-hero.
&#8216;Why not?&#8217; said the other wearily. &#8216;After
all, one more or one less, why should it matter
to either of us?&#8217; &#8216;I won&#8217;t,&#8217; said George,
&#8216;not if they shoot me for it.&#8217; &#8216;What?&#8217;
said Carl, &#8216;have you still a soul? Then by
God I can die in peace.&#8217; And with that he
shot himself through the heart. &#8216;Kiss me,
George,&#8217; he whispered, and George, dropping
me as though I were of no account,
kissed the crime-stained lips. And here in
consequence I have been ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what happened to George?&#8221; asked
the oldest poppy. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the grenade
easily, &#8220;I am not sure. I heard&mdash;(and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
hoped it was true) that he had been shot for
cowardice in the face of the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would patriots like that story?&#8221; inquired
the withered female poppy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said the pin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the poppy, &#8220;you do not
seem to me to make out a good case for
patriots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said the grenade hotly, &#8220;you
would not speak so if you were being threatened
by the hobnailed boots of a gross invader,
who was on the point of squashing
you flat. Then you would be glad enough to
have the protection of a patriot like myself.&#8221;
And the pin was so moved (and the sun so
hot) that he suddenly and violently exploded,
with the result that the poppies were scattered
in fragments to the four winds of heaven.</p>

<small>UNITED WE STAND</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NOW listen! and if you can possibly
avoid it don&#8217;t interrupt. In the far
and non-existent province of Arabia the
population consisted almost exclusively of
kings, except for the lower classes, who were,
as everybody knows, emperors. The kings
had it all their own way for years and years,
when suddenly the emperors formed a trade
society, popularly known as the Amalgamated
Emperors&#8217; Union. In pursuance of the
principle upon which all such societies rest
(in non-existent provinces), the emperors,
as a preliminary step, ceased the function
which distinguished their calling. The kings
were thereupon compelled to act both as
kings and emperors, which caused them inconvenience.
Accordingly they summoned a
special meeting of Sanhedrim&mdash;the Arabian
legislative assembly&mdash;and passed a law withdrawing
the right of association among
emperors (though naturally preserving it for
kings), and severely forbidding, under penalty,
what was described in the Act as &#8220;striking.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>In Arabia&mdash;that fabulous country&mdash;a law
on being duly passed by the kings becomes
automatically a law of nature. So that it is
very necessary to pay the greatest attention
to the drafting. On this occasion the framers
of the Bill had forgotten by an unaccountable
oversight to omit &#8220;clocks&#8221; from the exclusion
clause. In consequence all clocks in
the province automatically ceased striking,
and thereafter it was no use consulting an
Arabian constable because nobody in that
legendary land knew what o&#8217;clock it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said the publisher scornfully,
&#8220;you think that&#8217;s clever and Socialistic,
and all that sort of thing. Have you any idea
what wages we have to pay to the book-binders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked you not to interrupt,&#8221; said the
author. &#8220;Now you&#8217;ve prevented me from
explaining how the clock in the principal
mosque&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they have clocks in
mosques,&#8221; said the publisher.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;how the clock in the principal mosque
welcomed the change, observing that it for
one had always been in favour of methods of
conciliation. &#8216;And anyhow,&#8217; the church clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
continued as it finally ran down, &#8216;why bother
about time when you have eternity?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any aspirin?&#8221; inquired the
publisher.</p>

<small>SILENCE IS GOLDEN</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;YOU will observe,&#8221; remarked the
placid convict, negligently dropping
his pick on the warder&#8217;s foot, &#8220;that a very
few words express a great deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The warder, who had already expressed
more than a little in his first two words,
stopped abruptly, and with a graceful wave
of his hand bade the convict be seated. &#8220;For
this,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is a subject to which I
have devoted much thought, and you with
your varied experience of men and manners
should speak with authority.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; admitted the convict agreeably,
&#8220;that in the course of the commission
of a certain number of tolerably execrable
crimes I have been brought into contact with
many people, but I have made it a rule never
to allow my conversation to be affected by
the practical affairs of life. To be personal is
to be dull without redemption.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But in your case,&#8221; interrupted the warder,
&#8220;your experiences are so unusual that you
might well be forgiven for dwelling on them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&#8220;That,&#8221; retorted the felon, with a certain
graceful melancholy, &#8220;is the conviction of
every conversationalist. But I have never
supposed that a murder was necessarily interesting
just because I had perpetrated it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This sort of trait,&#8221; murmured the custodian
of the condemned, &#8220;elicits a man&#8217;s respect.
But,&#8221; he continued aloud, &#8220;what, then,
is left us to discuss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The universe,&#8221; smilingly returned the
convict, &#8220;and any other fictions you may
care to invent. The whole world loves a liar.
I admit,&#8221; he added, with a gentle shrug,
&#8220;that &#8216;Not guilty&#8217; was an error, but that
you will understand was more by way of
repartee than of continuous conversation. The
judge, after all, drew the retort on himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But truth, I have always understood, is
stranger&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me if I interrupt,&#8221; said the
criminal a little sternly, &#8220;but I cannot stand
by and hear a friend (for I include you in
that number),&#8221; he added courteously enough,
&#8220;quote proverbs. I can forgive your being a
warder of condemned men, but I cannot
stand your being a guardian of (forgive me!)
damned phrases.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>&#8220;You hold, then,&#8221; returned the warder,
a little confused, &#8220;that quotation is not admissible
in polite conversation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot quote a proverb,&#8221; earnestly
responded the prisoner, &#8220;any more than you
can butter a hypothesis. But I perceive,&#8221; he
went on more gently, &#8220;that I have fallen
into the fault of heat. Forgive a hotheadedness
which has more than once ruined my
conversation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have nothing to forgive,&#8221; cried
the custodian, much affected. &#8220;It is I who
am the more to blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, indeed, is true,&#8221; interjected the
Governor of the gaol, who had come up
unobserved during the latter part of the conversation,
&#8220;and, much as I shall regret your
loss, I must reconcile myself to it. While
you,&#8221; he went on, turning to the convict,
&#8220;will have leisure, when consuming bread
and water, to reflect whether, after all, there
is not something to be said for silence.&#8221;</p>

<small>LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP: OR,
REFLECTIONS BEFORE YOU JUMP</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp;AM tired of reflection,&#8221; said the looking-glass,
&#8220;I will now live my own life.&#8221;
As a first step to that end he succeeded in
rolling himself right out of his seventeenth-century
uprights and falling off the spindle-legged
dressing-table, oval face downwards,
on to a deep grey carpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; said the carpet, who was
rather a simple old-fashioned thing, though
of an excellent texture, &#8220;here is somebody
come down in the world. Ahem! I hope, sir,
that you are none the worse for your fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; replied the mirror, who
was rather bewildered by the fall and the
complete darkness in which his new situation
had placed him, &#8220;I precipitated myself to
the ground on purpose.&#8221; &#8220;What!&#8221; cried
the carpet, who feared that she had to do
with a self-murderer, &#8220;after full reflection?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without any reflection whatever,&#8221; cried
the mirror testily. &#8220;I am,&#8221; he added more
suavely, &#8220;entirely incapable of such an act.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>&#8220;Poor thing,&#8221; said the carpet soothingly,
for she now perceived that her affair was
merely with a madman. &#8220;If you will only
compose yourself I am sure you will be your
own man again immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see, madam,&#8221; said the mirror, &#8220;that
we do not understand each other. Let me
therefore explain my point of view. You must
know then that I am by nature a person of a
profoundly original turn of thought. Judge
then of my despair when a malignant fate
ordained for more than a century that I
should be tortured by serving merely to reflect
the follies and lack of grace of others. I
have borne things insupportable, and finally
I took the magnificent decision which has,
among, other agreeable circumstances of release,
conferred upon me the pleasure of your
conversation. You will conceive for yourself
my mental tumult when you used the word
&#8216;reflection.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, sir,&#8221; said the carpet, now much
distressed, &#8220;reflect. Are you not flying in the
face of Providence? If reflection was the gift
bestowed upon you by your designer would
you wantonly dissipate it? Such conduct,
believe me, must have the most dire results!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; neighed the mirror with an
accent that suggested his century, &#8220;I am, I
hope, a mirror of Feeling, and I know what
respect must ever be paid to the Fair. None
the less, I cannot leave you a prey to common
error, even though its removal should offend
your Female Delicacy. M&#8217;am, there is no
such thing as a designer, but each of us is his
own architect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No designer!&#8221; screamed the carpet.
&#8220;Now the weaver be good to me! Impious
creature, do you not know that we are each
of us made with nicely adjusted virtues and
qualities by an all-understanding maker?
And that to doubt this is to be damned beyond
hope of re-weaving?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what, m&#8217;am,&#8221; sneered the mirror,
&#8220;is your particular virtue?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be a comfort and a support to the
foot, an office of which I am proud,&#8221; replied
the carpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare swear,&#8221; said the mirror courteously,
&#8220;that you are perfect in it. But I do
not doubt that, were I called upon, I could
adjust myself to the same task in spite of all
the pretensions of your friend the designer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The carpet was spared the necessity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
continuing so sacrilegious a conversation by
the entry into the darkened room of its
owner. He stepped heavily in the direction
of the dressing-table, and stamped his riding-boot
hard on the back of the mirror, smashing
the glass to fragments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn!&#8221; he cried loudly, and after switching
on the lights rang for a servant. &#8220;Who
has been so d&mdash;d clumsy as to leave the old
mirror standing between the window and
the door?&#8221;</p>

<p>The servant picked up the mirror. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it&#8217;s only the glass
as is smashed. We could easy get a new one
put in, and you were always complaining
that the old one didn&#8217;t reflect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the owner, &#8220;but the
glass must be put right. Tell them to let me
see the designer before the work is begun&mdash;and
sweep up the litter of glass. By the way,
the carpet&#8217;s not injured, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said the servant, busily sweeping,
&#8220;the carpet&#8217;s perfectly all right.&#8221;</p>

<small>LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THERE is a good deal of talk in certain
circles,&#8221; said the deuce of spades
casually to the ace of hearts, &#8220;as to the need
for equality among cards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how,&#8221; inquired the ace amicably,
&#8220;is this equality to be established?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are three schools of thought,&#8221;
replied the deuce readily; &#8220;the first holds
that all cards should rank as deuce, while the
second that all should be aces. I myself have
ventured to favour a golden mean of all counting,
say, as nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a great deal in all these theories,&#8221;
replied the ace, &#8220;and I think one or other
should be immediately adopted. There is,
however, one point on which I should like
to sound a note of caution. I do not quite see
how in the altered circumstances any game is
to be played.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we have thought of that,&#8221; said the
deuce carelessly, &#8220;and frankly we do not see
the necessity of the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the ace, &#8220;I have nothing
more to say.&#8221;</p>

<small>QUIS SEPARABIT?</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO statesmen of well-merited celebrity
in their own countries and times,
having for a moment escaped the vigilance
of their warders, met in a comparatively
cool corner of hell to discuss the possibility
of forming a new government.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not feel,&#8221; said the first, &#8220;that H.H.
any longer really represents the feeling in the
circles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I entirely agree,&#8221; said the second; &#8220;he
is still, I fear, a hopeless reactionary and continues
to believe that there is a distinction
between evil and good&mdash;a doctrine which all
advanced thought has long since abandoned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And not only that,&#8221; said the first, &#8220;he
is still a prey to the war spirit. He is for ever
thinking in terms of the great conflict in
which he thinks he was defeated. As a matter
of fact, if he could only realise the truth,
heaven was by far the greater sufferer, and is
greatly embarrassed by the reparation exacted
from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one way,&#8221; said the second,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
&#8220;to repair the ravages of that unfortunate
misunderstanding, and that is to recognise
frankly that heaven and hell are necessary to
one another and to arrange for a policy of
goodwill and intercelestial understanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor should we stop at that,&#8221; replied the
first, taking fire, as well he might, at the
enunciation of sentiments so lofty; &#8220;mere
understanding is not enough. We must have
a pact, co-operation, even coalition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a common policy,&#8221; broke in the
second, &#8220;resting on the best of evil and
the worst of good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The only difficulty,&#8221; said the first, &#8220;that
I can see is one of the leadership.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not,&#8221; replied the second, &#8220;permit
these wretched personalities to interfere
with policies of universal benefit. Moreover,
I am sure that the two forces are both too
large-minded to let their personal inclinations
stand in the way. And in any case, is it not
possible that as a result of this great movement
they may come to realise&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried the first breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;that they themselves are one and the
same personality?&#8221;</p>

<small>MEN, NOT MEASURES</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WHAT is that little man with the soul
like a wet umbrella, that somebody
has left in a corner, doing?&#8221; inquired the
lovely, though scarcely visible, presence that
had unexpectedly materialised the night before
in the house of the Prime Minister of
Samaria.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; whispered his conductor, the
utterly outraged Private Secretary, &#8220;hush,
they will hear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fear,&#8221; said the radiant creature,
looking carefully at the faces of the assembled
Council, &#8220;my voice is of the kind that does
not reach their ears. Therefore tell me what
he is doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is keeping minutes,&#8221; said the Secretary,
a little sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does he do that?&#8221; inquired the angel.
&#8220;Were I in his place I would shoo them on
their way like a hen-yard full of hens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not understand,&#8221; said the
Secretary; &#8220;he is keeping a record of what is
happening.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>&#8220;But how does he know?&#8221; inquired the
angel.</p>

<p>&#8220;By listening to what these gentlemen
say,&#8221; replied the Secretary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; said the angel, &#8220;if that is his
only source of information I see that I must
help him,&#8221; and he walked across the Council
chamber to the side of the luckless clerk,
gently disregarding the frenzied gestures of
the Private Secretary.</p>

<p>The Clerk had made the following entry
in a neat flowing hand on a handsome sheet
of thick white paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prime Minister drew the Council&#8217;s
attention to the difficulties presented by the
Poets&#8217; Birth (Prevention) Bill. The object,
as his colleagues knew, was to secure that in
future poets should be made (if possible by
publicity) and not born. Everybody agreed
that democracy should have self-made poets,
that the pretensions of birth must cease. At
the same time it could not be denied that
poets insisted on being born. It would be
within his colleagues&#8217; recollection that a
number of poets had been made in the recent
list of honours. They were, he was happy to
say, perfect in every respect except that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
did not write poetry. For his part he preferred
that kind of poet, but it could not be
denied that the opponents of the measure
were making great play with this. He asked
for the views of his colleagues.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Minister of Higher Education asked
what poetry was?</p>

<p>&#8220;The Minister of Commerce entirely
agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Master of the Weasels thought that
there was much in what had been said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Senior Almoner had had a letter from
a very respectable washerwoman in his constituency.
She complained that there was a
poet who wore soft collars. He did not wish
to press the point, but popular feeling could
not be neglected.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Keeper of the Conscience took the
view that the time was ripe for action. Several
members of the Council concurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prime Minister, summing up, said
that he was glad to find his colleagues unanimous
in supporting the course he had proposed.
The division was likely to be a close
one. He especially appealed to Lord Albatross.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point the angel took possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the Clerk&#8217;s mind, and with a queer click the
faces of the men round the table were rolled
up like green railway carriage blinds, and
their minds became visible, working rather like
electric light studs being pressed off and on.
The Clerk continued to write the minutes:
&#8220;Not that Lord Albatross cared, but his
stud would fidget his neck, and he couldn&#8217;t
be expected to listen to the Prime Minister&#8217;s
neat periods with a rasping stud. The other
eighteen fellers probably had got their studs
right. Anyhow, judgin&#8217; by their serious looks,
they had better things than studs to think
about. Queer thing how complete they all
looked&mdash;if you know what I mean. Couldn&#8217;t
imagine them ever having not worn morning
coats or neat grey tweeds and a sort of sewn-up-and-sent-home-hoping-it&#8217;s-to-your-complete-satisfaction
look. Except &#8216;Conky,&#8217;
the Lord High Wig. &#8216;Conky&#8217; was dressed up
like himself&mdash;a sort of suit consistin&#8217; of a
heavy jowled face, glass eyes, looming
stomach and the rest. Joke if they found him
and &#8216;Conky&#8217; out and gave them the push
for having sneaked into the room during a
Council.&#8221; Albatross suppressed a chuckle.</p>

<p>The P.M. looked at him coldly. &#8220;Damn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the fellow with his aristocratic sharpness.
There he sat looking like a stuck pig, and all
the time he had followed every word and
seen through the whole caboodle. That&#8217;s
the worst of mixing classes. They&#8217;ve got their
own cold, fishy way of nosing through the
water, and snap&mdash;they&#8217;re on the fly, when
you thought them fast asleep. They&#8217;d never
understand each other&mdash;never. Here was he
not caring a row of beans (or has-beens, he
added, viciously looking round) as to what
the result of the division would be. What he
wanted was friendship. He wanted them all
to see that he wasn&#8217;t just the best thing in
talking machines that had been invented.
Groping to them he was&mdash;to their hearts.
Well, why not? They had hearts, hadn&#8217;t they?
And just when he was stretching out a hand
to gather in the strings this cold fellow fetches
out his knife of laughter. Not human, that&#8217;s
what was wrong. Born like a little Eastern
idol. He should have stuck to his own lot.
There was Crayfish, the Senior Almoner.
He sympathised. He stood shoulder to
shoulder. Damn! getting the rhetoric into
his thoughts! Still Crayfish would pull it
through, if only to irritate Albatross and Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Conkers. If he didn&#8217;t, well he&#8217;d get back to
humans at last. He had a right, hadn&#8217;t he, to
be a man.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Minister of Commerce was drawing
one O after another on his pad. Who did the
perfect circle? Forget my own name next.
Just ask old Crayfish&mdash;only chap in the room
who&#8217;s ever read anything except <i>The Morning
News</i>&mdash;begging Albatross&#8217; pardon&mdash;and <i>The
Blue &#8217;Un</i>. Silly to have got cluttered up with
this gang, and yet what a wonder the P.M.
was. Never felt a thing in his life. Could make
a bed&mdash;mattress and all&mdash;out of two adjectives
and a noun. Yes, and the right adjectives
too&mdash;right in a popular sense that is. But as a
literary proposition, O Lord! How odd,
though, to live by words that weren&#8217;t words
so much as gestures and nothing behind them.
Like Hume&mdash;association of well, not ideas, but
penny plain dressed up as tuppeny coloured.
Like a series of ballads hawked by a man in
the street hung all round him and no man in
the middle. Funny how not being a man he
gets real men like old Crayfish for instance.
That&#8217;s the one&mdash;no rhetoric for him. Look
at his tense simple eyes. He thinks only of
what&#8217;s best and loyalty, and if sincerity can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
get the damned thing through he&#8217;ll do it.
Now I wonder if he does know who did the
perfect circle?...&#8221;</p>

<p>The blinds clicked down again. The
Master of the Weasels was standing over the
Clerk pouring some brandy down his throat.
The Clerk blinked his eyes and recovered
suddenly. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, sir, I must have
fainted. I&#8217;m afraid that I&#8217;ve missed part of
the discussion.&#8221; &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said
the Prime Minister, looking at the notes, from
which the angelic interpolations had disappeared.
&#8220;Nobody said a thing while you
were off.&#8221; &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the Clerk happily,
&#8220;then nothing happened. Will you sign the
minutes?&#8221;</p>

<small>YOU CANNOT HAVE YOUR CAKE
AND EAT IT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">A CERTAIN business-man in Damascus,
whose efficiency was only surpassed
by his personal ugliness, was informed
that in a distant vilayet dwelt a peasant of
whom it was currently rumoured that he
possessed a goose that laid eggs of pure gold.</p>

<p>He accordingly chartered a caravan, and
with much jingling of silver bells set out
across the desert to make a proposition to
the peasant. In his company was a young man
who was reputed (though it had not been
finally brought home to him) to be a poet.
Whether this were true or no, it cannot be
denied that he paid much heed to the ascensions
of the moon.</p>

<p>On the third day of the pilgrimage that
pale planet was bewitching in her pensive
hair the reluctant black beauty of the desert.
All was still except when a grave camel kneeling
shook a bell. But presently, with the clear
monotony of a bird, the young man&#8217;s voice
was heard singing:</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;In this cold glory</div>
<div class="verse">of midnight, day</div>
<div class="verse">and her fever</div>

</div>

<div class="first">&#8220;Here in the quiet,</div>
<div class="verse">here in the cool,</div>
<div class="verse">even pain, even sorrow</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;And the voice of the poet</div>
<div class="verse">lifts and lingers</div>
<div class="verse">at one in the dark</div>
<div class="verse">with the older singers.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;As I feared,&#8221; said the merchant, raising
his head from his silken and tasselled pillow,
&#8220;the fellow is a poet. I must cope with this.&#8221;
Thereupon he lifted the flap of his embroidered
tent, and in a sleeping suit, of which the
radiant texture did not conceal the irregular
contours of his frame, with one arm behind
his back, strode across the sand to where, in
a patch of shadow, the poet was crooning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young man,&#8221; said the merchant, breaking
somewhat harshly on the singer&#8217;s reverie,
&#8220;was that your own poem?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was, merchant,&#8221; replied the poet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
&#8220;but now, since you have heard it, it is yours
also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said the merchant craftily,
&#8220;how much would you be paid for such a
poem in Damascus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were lucky,&#8221; said the poet, &#8220;I might
earn a kiss, or if unlucky a dinah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dinah,&#8221; said the merchant. &#8220;By the
beard of the Prophet, no bad pay for a mouthful
of sweet words. And is it difficult to acquire
the trick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All that is needed,&#8221; answered the poet,
&#8220;is a rose behind the ear and the moon behind
the heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Damascus,&#8221; cried the merchant, &#8220;I
have a hanging garden stained with roses,
and at night the moon rises in the garden.
My ears are longer than yours, and my heart,
if one may judge by a comparison of our
persons, is incomparably larger. I will accordingly
give up the quest of the goose, and will
return to Damascus and in my rose garden
lay my own golden eggs. But in the meantime,&#8221;
he added reflectively, stabbing the
poet to the heart with the pearl-handled
scimitar which he had hitherto concealed,
&#8220;I may as well dispose of a dangerous rival.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>&#8220;O fool,&#8221; whispered the dying poet, &#8220;it
was only the goose who thought the eggs
gold, because of the golden goslings hidden
in their cool blue shell, as the peasant discovered
when he killed her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did she think so?&#8221; said the merchant,
daintily wiping the curved blade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because she was a poet,&#8221; whispered the
dying man. &#8220;And why did she tell the
peasant?&#8221; asked the merchant, preparing
to return to his interrupted rest. &#8220;Because,&#8221;
said the poet, turning over on his side with a
little sigh, &#8220;because she was a goose.&#8221;</p>

<small>IN VINO VERITAS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THE next story,&#8221; said the author,
&#8220;will be an example of grim realism.
It will have no characters and no incidents
and no meaning. It will continue for
some three or four hundred pages, and will
begin in the middle and not end at all. There
will also be a tendency for verbs and punctuation
to disappear simultaneously, and a
slightly stagnant atmosphere of muddled
gloom will reproduce the sensation of a
London fog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know,&#8221; said the publisher,
&#8220;that you had read Tchekov. For my part
I have not, and let me add I do not intend
that my public should.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not even know,&#8221; replied the author,
&#8220;what Tchekov is, though by the sound it
might be a Slavonic parlour game. But if,
as always, you are going to thwart me just
when I am about to strike a modern note, I
will tell you quite simply and (I hope) beautifully
an old-fashioned Christmas story.
About the year 1840,&#8221; said the author, &#8220;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the City of London, and to be particular in
the immediate neighbourhood of a cosy, rosy,
prosy old coaching inn in the Borough, lived,
or rather existed (for he was a wicked old
screw was Jonathan), a merchant in the tea
trade (at least he let it be understood that it
was the tea trade, but the gossips, who stood
about at the street corners with very blue
noses waiting for the muffin-boy, had their
suspicions that&mdash;&mdash;)&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not,&#8221; interjected the publisher,
&#8220;wish to be unduly curious. But may I ask
whether there are any other sentences in this
story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; retorted the author, with
justifiable heat, &#8220;but if I am to tell this story
at all perhaps you will permit me to tell it in
an old-fashioned way. Let me tell you that
in 1840 people had time to finish sentences
like that, yes and to understand them. A man
who could stand the factory system of the
time could stand anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued the author, &#8220;there
existed in that neighbourhood Jonathan
Gogglesnape, and as is general with persons
who had acquired names of that sort, he was
the hardest, grindingest miser that you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
find in a smart day&#8217;s walk, east, west, south
or north of the pump on the left hand corner
of the square of St. Runnymede-in-the-East.
Jonathan was at all times of the year a cold,
pinched figure of a man in a tight, rusty surtout,
and not an inch of linen showing either
at the mean, scraggy throat or the large red
wrists, but at five o&#8217;clock on Christmas Eve
he was a circumstance, like the whistling
wind, to make comfortable folks draw closer
to the fire and to thank their Maker and the
Spirit of Christmas that they were not as
other men.</p>

<p>&#8220;A sharp fall of snow, as yet untrodden
into filth and mud, had smoothed out the
vices of the pavement and given that touch
of happy contrast between the radiant revellers
within and the homeless wanderers without

<small>TANTAE RELIGIO</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AND another thing. In the gardens
of Haroun-al-Raschid, just past the
corner where one pale rose watches her
tranquil shadow in the ice-blue water of a
marbled pond, grew a black tree that could
not wait for the Arabian spring. But on the
contrary, instead of leaves she threw over
her graceful shoulders a cloak sprigged with
red blossom. And that in a single night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh miracle,&#8221; said the first gardener next
morning when he observed this bright irregularity,
&#8220;red snow has fallen in the night.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh marvel,&#8221; said the second, &#8220;a swarm of
red butterflies.&#8221; &#8220;Oh wonder,&#8221; cried the third,
&#8220;a little lanthorn in each lighted twig.&#8221;
&#8220;You must be blind,&#8221; said the first; &#8220;or a
numbskull,&#8221; said the second; &#8220;or mad,&#8221;
cried the third. And thereupon, as was only
to be expected, the three fell to fighting
furiously one with another.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are those men doing?&#8221; whispered
the terrified blossoms to the mother tree;
&#8220;we are afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&#8220;Hush! blossoms,&#8221; murmured the tree,
&#8220;they think that we are a divine manifestation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked the blossoms.</p>

<p>&#8220;The appearance of the God they worship
upon earth,&#8221; replied the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how do you know,&#8221; cried the
blossoms, &#8220;that they think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said the tree as the last gardener
fell heavily to the ground, &#8220;they are
killing one another.&#8221;</p>

<small>ON ENTERTAINING ANGELS
UNAWARES</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE pale-faced man with the slightly
Jewish cast of countenance was observed
for the first time on the night of the
27th June passing through the churchyard
by the Vicar, who, taking him, not unnaturally,
for a loafer, ordered him out pretty
sharply. He obeyed with remarkable meekness
and disappeared rapidly in the direction
of the house of Mrs. Bolpus. He was next
seen on the following evening&mdash;a cold, clear
night of moon&mdash;by the village ninny, or so it
was supposed. For he came back shouting
some nonsense about a lighted man, and
laughed happily and quietly all night.</p>

<p>It was, however, her ladyship who met
him in broad daylight two days later, and
engaged him in conversation. For she had
heard of his appearance and feared that he
might be a new scandal. She had intended to
begin by speaking to him roundly, but something
soft and flickering in his eyes stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
her. Instead of reproving him, therefore, she
said, speaking almost as to an equal:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are thinking of forming a branch of
the Society of Poor Lost Things in the village,
and we wondered whether you would care
to join?&#8221; &#8220;Strange,&#8221; he replied in a low
but beautifully clear voice, &#8220;I was also thinking
of forming a society. But perhaps our
objects are the same! What is yours?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the lady, &#8220;we aim at sweetening
bitter lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the stranger earnestly,
&#8220;I would like to give all I have. It is, I fear,&#8221;
he added with a smile, &#8220;only a guinea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are joking, I see,&#8221; murmured the
lady, signing a receipt with a gold pencil.
&#8220;And now, sir, will you forgive me if I make
a personal observation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But of course,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are lodging with Mrs. Bolpus. As a
stranger you cannot know her reputation. If
I might without impertinence suggest it,
perhaps it would be wise to find a less questionable
landlady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; mused the stranger, &#8220;she
seemed poor and unhappy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so she should,&#8221; cut in the lady.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;Indeed I should have described her as a
Poor Lost Thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see,&#8221; said the benefactress icily,
taking the guinea out of her purse, &#8220;that
you have misunderstood the objects of the
Society. We assist only the deserving.&#8221; &#8220;In
my Society,&#8221; said the man, sadly pocketing
his coins, &#8220;we assist first the undeserving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I should imagine,&#8221; sneered her ladyship,
&#8220;and what do you call it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the stranger gently, turning
away, &#8220;we call it the Society of the Rich
Lost Things, for whom the way to the kingdom
of heaven is through the eye of a needle.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said her ladyship to the Earl,
her husband, at dinner, &#8220;that you will arrange
for Mrs. Bolpus to be evicted at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Evicted!&#8221; said the Earl; &#8220;but haven&#8217;t
you heard the news? She died this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Died!&#8221; gasped the lady; &#8220;then what
was the Jew with the beard doing in her
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Jew with the beard?&#8221; asked her
husband. &#8220;I was there to-day and didn&#8217;t
hear of anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; cried the Countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite!&#8221; said the Earl, &#8220;but wait! Is
it perhaps the tramp that the Vicar saw in
the churchyard and poor Geordie Brown&#8217;s
&#8216;lighted man&#8217;? I think myself that in both
cases it was just imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; replied the lady after a long
pause, &#8220;but all the same I shall resign my
chairmanship of the branch of the Poor Lost
Things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what in the name of God&mdash;&mdash;,&#8221;
began the Earl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; almost screamed his wife.</p>

<small>YOU CAN TAKE A HORSE TO THE
WATER</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONCE upon a time (and you will see
later that it was fortunately not twice
upon this time) in the garden of the ChÃ¢teau
of Nyon, in the sweet heart of a lime tree and
very near to the little padded box where they
keep the silkworms, there lived a chrysalis,
whose ancestors had come over with John
Knox, but who nevertheless agreed with
Hume.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Almighty,&#8221; he said, speaking with
what he conceived to be a Scottish accent,
&#8220;is merely a prrojection of the chrysalis mind&mdash;a
varra puir exemple of the association of
incomparable ideas. Now Kant, as every
Scotsman knows, dragged in the soul&mdash;a
silly bit fluttering thing with white wings&mdash;the
great gowk. Mon, it&#8217;s a peety....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Qu&#8217;est que tu me chantes lÃ ,&#8221; exclaimed
an elderly silk-worm, who was busily occupied
in his exquisite occupation. &#8220;Execrable
worm, thinkest thou that because thou art
no better than a dried twig that all suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
from such misfortune? It is indeed certain
that upon such as thee the good God has not
wasted a soul, but as to me I know that the
delicate machine which can spin so marvellous
a net was not meant to fade into dust. But
what can one expect of one whose forefathers
were generated in a fog, lived in an east wind,
and died without ever having seen the sun?&#8221;
and with this the silk-worm resumed his
tapestry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; exclaimed the chrysalis, &#8220;is it
Scotland you&#8217;re naming in the same breath
wi&#8217; your God-forgotten, pope-ridden, frog-warren?
A&#8217;m black ashamed, ah am, and
metaphysic or no a&#8217;ll no ha it said that any
trapesing piece of a Frenchy had a soul and
me from the Clachans of the Tolbooth no.
But mind,&#8221; he added as he burst, and from
his husk daintily, like a lace handkerchief
out of lavender, rose the butterfly, &#8220;my
opeenions remain unchanged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I also,&#8221; said the silk-worm, &#8220;who have
all the years had faith, will take wings.&#8221; And
he breathed very hard and deep, but the only
result was that he spoiled his skein.</p>

<small>HALF A LOAF IS BETTER THAN NO
BREAD</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONCE upon a time there lived in a
cathedral city, almost in the shadow
of the minster, a middle-aged freethinker,
who was exceedingly angry with God for
not existing. Nor was he conciliated by those
who pointed out (reasonably enough) that
it was not His fault. This, in the view of the
freethinker, merely increased the offence.
&#8220;He should have thought of all that before,&#8221;
he would say grimly.</p>

<p>In the same town, but actually in the
minster itself, yes and in a hole in the pulpit,
lived a mouse, who, for her part, did not
agree with the freethinker. She was, I fear,
not as independent a mind as she should
have been, and permitted herself to be influenced
by the singularly sweet voice of the
principal officiating priest. Him she (foolishly)
identified with the creator of the ample
mansion of her choice, and indeed let it be
understood among her acquaintance that
she was peculiarly acceptable in his sight.
&#8220;For,&#8221; she said, &#8220;every day he comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
dressed all in white when the sun strikes
through the windows, throwing a coloured
shadow on his robe, and scatters precious
bread for me on a stainless cloth. And in
further proof,&#8221; she would say to scoffers,
&#8220;there is a second and lesser angel, who
salutes him, calling him by his name of &#8216;Our
Father in Heaven.&#8217;&#8221; Several mice who
doubted her story came at her invitation to
scoff and remained to eat the sacred crumbs.</p>

<p>Now it was exactly this matter of the bread
which above all other Christian uses most
inflamed the freethinker. When he was not
railing at the superstition of those who believed
that a celestial body could be concealed
in milled and baked ears of corn, he
was complaining against the waste of good
bread. He would calculate a statistic of the
annual diversion of bread to this purpose.
&#8220;Think of the poor!&#8221; he would snort, but it
is not certain that he thought of them himself.</p>

<p>The freethinker&#8217;s habit in the spring
months of the year was to take an early turn
along the quiet and flowery streets. The clean
and morning beauty was for him an anodyne,
and when he was certain of escaping observation
he would on occasion slip through a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
postern gate in the cathedral and brood
happily upon the base uses to which a structure
so noble had been addressed. During one
of these intrusions he observed that the cloth
was laid on the high altar and that the priest
was preparing the communion service. As
no worshippers appeared, the freethinker
drew near to the altar in order to satisfy himself
by personal witness of the futility of the
celebration.</p>

<p>The priest did not observe (or did not
appear to observe) his visitor, but completed
the ritual as though in the company of a great
host. &#8220;Buffoonery!&#8221; muttered the freethinker,
struggling angrily against the radiant charm
of the sun falling through old glass. &#8220;Bad
enough,&#8221; he continued in an audible whisper,
&#8220;to serve bread to those who do not need it,
but to serve it to nobody at all&mdash;&mdash;!!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure,&#8221; said the priest, who had
finished the service, &#8220;that it is for nobody?&#8221;
and he pointed smiling to the tiny grey communicants
nibbling the crumbs. &#8220;Do I
understand,&#8221; inquired the freethinker icily,
&#8220;that you perform this service for the sake
of the mice?&#8221; &#8220;Why not,&#8221; said the
priest; &#8220;as you do to the least of these&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
&#8220;This,&#8221; said the freethinker, quite properly
indignant, &#8220;is what I should call blasphemy.&#8221;
&#8220;And of that,&#8221; said the priest, turning to go
to the vestry, &#8220;you should be no mean judge.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said the verger to the priest later
in the day, &#8220;them mice have been about
again. I see two of them at the sacred bread.
I wish you would let me set traps.&#8221; &#8220;Why,&#8221;
said the priest, &#8220;I have already set one.&#8221;
&#8220;And did you catch anything?&#8221; asked the
verger. &#8220;I think so,&#8221; said the priest.</p>

<small>IN FOR A PENNY IN FOR A
POUND</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a beautiful line of
poetry who had by an unfortunate
accident lodged herself in the brain of an
extremely inferior poet. To her great discomfort
the line found herself driven to
associate with a disorderly mob of worn-out
and shabby phrases. Nor was this all. While
her companions were for ever being taken
out and aired, and on occasion finding their
way into the public prints, she remained
neglected and disused.</p>

<p>The other lines, who had from the first
disliked her, now, not unnaturally, added
contempt to their dislike. &#8220;The truth is,&#8221;
they said to her, &#8220;that you are not one of us.
The rest of us can all point to a long and
distinguished ancestry. Everybody knew our
parents and knows us. We are welcome wherever
we go, and are readily admitted into the
best society. But as for you, your birth is
wrapt in mystery. Whether it is the fact that
the poet is your father is open to question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
but at any rate there is no question whatever
of the character of the Greek woman your
mother. You had better,&#8221; they would conclude,
&#8220;return whence you came, where,
among persons of your own kind, you will
no doubt be at ease.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poet, meanwhile, only dimly aware
of his golden visitor, continued to fumble
among his ready-for-service shelves. This
was the easier for him as all his ideas were
of stock size, and were in consequence easily
fitted by the poetic slops. But as time went
on the poet became more and more acutely
aware of something that waited expression&mdash;some
queer new-shaped Jack o&#8217; lanthorn
of a thought that none of his ready-made
suits would fit. One after another he took
them down, and they seemed incorrigibly
stale and shop-soiled. Even the most daring
patterns in the earlier Brooke design seemed
inadequate, out at the seams and unfresh.</p>

<p>He blamed his liver. Then he blamed his
wife, and last&mdash;most horrible thought of all&mdash;he
blamed his inspiration. &#8220;I have written
myself out,&#8221; he cried to the pool of light that
the lamp cast on his solitary desk. &#8220;This is
the end.&#8221; He rehearsed in a high tragic voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
some of his most notable triumphs, as for
example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="first">&#8220;Now that the roses are over</div>
<div class="indent">And the last white rose is dead,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;Instead of love freely given</div>
<div class="indent">To love that asked for no price,</div>

<div class="indent">And the last white rose is dead,</div>
<div class="verse">Quiet returns to the lover</div>
<div class="indent5">Instead.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; he cried to the unreceptive
almond blossoms on the wall-paper. &#8220;What
genius I had when I wrote that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down at the desk and looked severely
at the virgin page. No neat rhymes again, no
passion tied up in brown paper and looped
with string for a finger, no beauty sent home
with the first delivery. &#8220;This,&#8221; he repeated
with melancholy grandeur, &#8220;is the end.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>And at that directly minute he saw a line
form itself in letters of flame along the page,
as though a candle wrote it&mdash;a lovely line
with the sovereign note of Cleopatra&#8217;s cry:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from the world&#8217;s great snare uncaught?&#8221;</p>

<p>For one wild moment his spirit, overlaid
with swathe upon swathe of rubbish, moved
upwards to the light. For whatever he was
now, he had once been a poet, if only in his
hopes. In that luminous instant he almost
guessed his failure. &#8220;The end,&#8221; he muttered;
&#8220;suppose it were the beginning?&#8221; With that
the old lines that had suffered defeat resumed
their empire. &#8220;Yes, the beginning,&#8221; he cried,
&#8220;the beginning,&#8221; and radiant he began to
write, sure of his inspiration:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a beautiful poem,&#8221; said the editor
of his favourite journal when it was sent to
him. &#8220;Not so bad,&#8221; said the poet modestly.
&#8220;The fact is, it all started with a line&mdash;a
direct inspiration.&#8221; &#8220;What was it?&#8221; inquired
the editor languidly. &#8220;Well, to be perfectly
honest,&#8221; replied the poet, &#8220;I&#8217;ve forgotten
it.&#8221;</p>

<small>QUANTITY IS BETTER THAN
QUALITY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THIS is the thirty-first story,&#8221; said
the publisher; &#8220;how many more do
you propose to write?&#8221; &#8220;The question
you should have asked,&#8221; replied the
author, &#8220;is how many less?&#8221; &#8220;Less than
what?&#8221; inquired the publisher irritably.
&#8220;Less than what I could if I&#8217;m not stopped.
I am like the princess who when she opened
her mouth breathed jewels, which her detractors
alleged were toads&mdash;jewels, I would
observe, four words long which on the
stretched forefinger&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; &#8220;I have my own
opinion,&#8221; said the publisher firmly, &#8220;on
the question of jewels and toads! I think
forty would constitute a full drove or clutch,
or whatever a group of that species is called.&#8221;
&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the author, deeply
affronted, &#8220;I will now tell you the sad incident
which I am bound, in view of your
attack upon me, to call &#8216;Quantity is better
than Quality.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was once,&#8221; said the author, &#8220;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the eastern marches of a highly-constitutionalised
monarchy, a society whose members
were pledged to breathe only once a week.
They aspired by the force of this remarkable
example to discourage the distressing continuity
of breathing among the lower classes.
Now it must be obvious at once that even
well-born persons could only impose this
limitation upon themselves if assisted by
nature. And nature had assisted them. For
to reveal the truth (which they had concealed
from the warm-blooded proletariat), they were
not only blue-blooded but actually cold-blooded.
It will be seen therefore that their
action, though in itself meritorious, involved
a less sacrifice than was commonly represented
by their champions.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the outset their efforts were openly
derided by the lowest classes, who, so far
from ceasing to breathe, if anything breathed
more and louder than ever. But fortunately
in that country there was a middling class&mdash;known
for purposes of reference as the backbone
of the country&mdash;who knew how to value
their social superiors. These, therefore, with
much agony and spiritual exercise, began to
practise the new mode, letting it be gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
understood that breathing was vulgar. Their
contortions, as may well be imagined, afforded
much amusement to the society and received,
as was right, a considerable measure of public
approbation at their hands. Unluckily, however,
the middling class tended to carry the
matter too far. For in their excess of zeal
they not only reduced the amount of their
breathing, but even ceased breathing altogether.
In such cases the formula &#8216;He (or
she) is not dead but sleeps&#8217; was generally
applied. For no one would admit the social
disgrace of being dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody knows how long this engaging
state of affairs would have continued if it had
not been for a cessation of work by the Banded
Guild of Sextons and Gravediggers. These
simple fellows naturally welcomed the increase
of business that came their way as the
result of the new fashion. But unhappily they
became involved in a serious demarcation
dispute with another association&mdash;&#8220;The
Society of Critics, Essayists and Writers of
Belles Lettres.&#8221; This latter body, it had always
been recognised, were alone entitled to bury
the living (with a subsidiary function of resurrecting
the dead). They protested accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
with the greatest vigour against the invasion
of their sphere by a guild whose affair was
solely (as their own rules showed) with the
dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Government of the country, quite
properly and according to the accepted practice,
attempted to hush the matter up. But the
Society of Critics were able by virtue of their
association with the newspaper press to defeat
this laudable endeavour. To the disgust of
the remainder of the middling class, and in
spite of the advice freely tendered by some
of the older soldiers among the upper class,
to the effect that the matter should be decided
by the general execution of all members of
both rival bodies, the question was remitted
for decision to an impartial arbitrator. After
a long hearing and the most anxious consideration
this gentleman issued his award.
It was a long and cogently written document,
and aroused general dissatisfaction. For
among other illuminating observations, he
pointed out that if a man is only as old as he
feels, then, <i>a fortiori</i>, he is only as dead as he
admits. This was generally regarded by the
critics as a decision in their favour. On the
other hand, the sextons drew attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
another portion of the report, in which the
arbitrator eloquently reminded those who had
appointed him that his countrymen, whose
proud boast was that they did not know when
they were beaten, would still less be likely to
know when they were dead. His final recommendation
was, however, equally distasteful
to both parties. For he concluded by observing
that to those who were of like mind with
him there was no death. He would refer to M.
Maeterlinck, the well-known Belgian expert
on bees: &#8216;Death,&#8217; he began in a passage
long after quoted in the schools, &#8216;is the door
of life.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The issue being thus left in doubt, the
sextons&mdash;warm-blooded as they were and
breathing noisily&mdash;cut the knot by a general
cessation of work. The critics, though invited
by an enthusiastic press to show their quality,
restricted themselves to stating publicly that
the pen was mightier than the spade, and
leaving it there.</p>

<p>&#8220;The deadlock was only resolved by announcement
on the part of the head of the
Government (the coldness of whose blood
was sufficiently established to condone any
eccentricity) that in future he for one would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
breathe continuously. To which an even
colder (and bluer) blooded colleague of ducal
rank added that he would not merely breathe
but actually snore.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was, however, made clear that this
announcement was entirely spontaneous and
had no connection with the deplorable stoppage
of work. In the result the middling class
resumed their breathing. The sextons returned
to their diminished labours, and the
critics, discovering a new and living novelist
of genius, set about his interment with renewed
vigour. And thus,&#8221; concluded the
author, &#8220;we see that Quantity is better than
Quality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talking of toads,&#8221; said the publisher.
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the author, &#8220;let us talk of
them. I remember that they have jewels in
their foreheads.&#8221; &#8220;Then yours,&#8221; snarled the
publisher, &#8220;must have turned their backs.&#8221;</p>

<small>CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">FROM time to time, or rather from
eternity to eternity, Ormuzd finds
himself inconvenienced by the perpetual
praise offered up to him by the blessÃ©d.
Though he is very anxious not to hurt their
feelings, he cannot but wonder whether such
complete absence of the critical faculty constitutes
the best of company.</p>

<p>It is in this mood that Ahriman, always
sensitive to the All-Highest emotions, ventures
to appear and exchange insults with the
Senior Power. And he has a double reason.
He has a perfectly devilish capacity for feeling
sorry for himself in exile. It is, however,
more than that. Like Ormuzd, he is concerned
not to wound the susceptibilities of
his constituents, but some eternities he
permits himself to ask whether uninterrupted
blasphemies may not jar an ear specially
designed for their reception.</p>

<p>&#8220;This constant preoccupation with another
place,&#8221; he would think, &#8220;is not very
flattering to me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&#8220;And so, my poor Ahriman,&#8221; Ormuzd
would say on these occasions, &#8220;you are still
dissatisfied? But I do not see what more I
can do for you. I have given you rule over
half the universe. I cannot give you the power
to enjoy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sire,&#8221; replies the impudent fiend,
&#8220;since charity begins at home&mdash;if I may
describe heaven by so inappropriate a
title.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you,&#8221; says Ormuzd, &#8220;what
really ails you, Ahriman? It is not that evil
is a mocker, not that it tears down idols, and
least of all that it is outrageously clever. The
painful truth, on the contrary,&#8221; says Ormuzd
gently, &#8220;is that evil is so stupid.&#8221; This, as
may be supposed, wounds Ahriman in a very
tender spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sire,&#8221; says he, &#8220;if it were possible for
you to be unjust I should so describe that
observation. For consider! All round with
the docility of inspired sheep the blameless
lift their monotonous outcries. They worship
what is worshipful, I allow, but how without
perception of its subtleties, of its trembling
poise upon the edge of disaster. The blessed
croon like old women before the fire, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
they do not guess (or care) that the roots of
the flame are in hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are still stupid,&#8221; answers
Ormuzd, &#8220;for these adore what they do not
understand, while you hate what you insist on
misunderstanding. Here am I, Ormuzd&mdash;a
symbol, a golden knob on a door that none
can press&mdash;a veil of silver&mdash;and here are you,
Ahriman, also an ebon metaphor of what is
too dark to be apprehended. And yet, poor
Ahriman, you being so dark a ghost rail upon
me being a ghost so bright. But what of that
which is behind us both?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ormuzd,&#8221; says Ahriman, &#8220;you cannot
cheat me thus. You are a thing in my mind,
as I am a thing in yours, and if our thoughts
cease, both of us cease with them. After us
the Deluge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; says Ormuzd, &#8220;that the thing
you see is made up of your sight, but it is not
true of me. For that is the difference between
good and evil. I know that I am nothing, but
you believe (falsely) that you are everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humility,&#8221; sneers the fiend, &#8220;sits ill on
the thundering lips of Ormuzd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Truth,&#8221; replies Ormuzd, &#8220;is neither
proud nor humble; it is.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>&#8220;What is truth?&#8221; mocks the fiend, preparing
to go. &#8220;I suppose that you will tell
me that you are the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says Ormuzd, &#8220;it is because you
deny that I am truth and secretly believe it
that you are Ahriman, but it is because I
know that I am not the truth that I am
Ormuzd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have enjoyed our little chat,&#8221; says
Ahriman, &#8220;but you lack ambition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By that sin&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; begins Ormuzd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense,&#8221; cries Ahriman hotly, and
then repents of his rudeness. &#8220;Forgive me,
sire, but I could believe in you if you believed
in yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahriman, Ahriman,&#8221; says Ormuzd,
laughing lightly, &#8220;still tempting me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bear you no grudge,&#8221; says Ahriman.
&#8220;The truth is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; asks Ormuzd.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you are too clever for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought we should come to it in the
end,&#8221; says Ormuzd.</p>

<small>DIS ALITER VISUM</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AT the beginning of the nineteenth
century, somewhere in Germany there
was a neat little town with gabled houses and
a platform for the stork in the market-place.
There was nothing remarkable about this
town or its people. By day the houses slumbered
cosily and the men went about their
cobbling, saddling, and carpentry with the
best will in the world. At evening lights were
shown at the windows, and within doors the
husbands smoked their long pipes with their
pot of beer close at hand, and the wives sewed
innumerable patches on innumerable small
pants. In spring and summer tables were set
in the trim garden, and at evening a stranger
passing down the cobbled street would have
seen amiable family groups each under their
linden-tree absorbing their evening meal.
And sometimes one more given to sentiment
than another might divide the calm evening
air with some monotonous ditty locally
assumed to be music. But the great day was
Sunday. Then the whole township, with bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
heads, moved to the church, where the pastor
preached the virtues of the ideal, of charity,
and of peace. And his flock, as harmless as
any other sheep, from time to time bleated
sympathetically and with the air of impending
sleep. And later in the day the same pastor, who
was something of a poet, would often collect a
group round him in the schoolroom and tell
them one of the &#8220;MÃ¤rchen,&#8221; to which even the
grown-ups were never tired of listening.</p>

<p>As you may suppose, among other stories
he would often tell them the tale of &#8220;Schneevitchen,&#8221;
or, as we call it, &#8220;Snow-white.&#8221;
The jealous stepmother, the mirror of beauty,
the poisoned apple, the dwarfs and the sleeping
lovely were murmured into the inner
conscience of his audience. And so all might
have continued till the end of time. The little
town might have dusked and shone night and
day, the quiet inhabitants have gone about
their business, lived and died, and new
storks replaced the old ones on the platform.
All this, I say, might have happened if two
strangers had not come to the little town and
settled in a vacant house almost next door to
that of the pastor. They were, so it was
understood, husband and wife, though many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
wondered how two persons so repulsive
could ever have endured that relationship.
The man was not otherwise ill-looking, but
so thin that in certain lights you would have
sworn that you could see his very bones, and
there were those who declared that the wind
would have whistled through him if it had
not been for his absurdly ill-fitting clothes.
The woman, on the other hand, was fat, not
with a comfortable tissue, but with a gross
hardness that forbade all friendliness. She
was not a monstrosity, save at meals, when
she ate like a beast out of the woods, hugely,
violently, and with the worst manners in the
world.</p>

<p>At the outset they were regarded with
suspicion. For though they were good customers
of the shops and paid cash, no one
could deny that they were ugly customers.
There was, further, something queer about
their name. It was not a decent German one
with a flavour of wurst about it, but was a
queer foreign one. For it was plain that the
baker, who had written it down as Tod, must
have misheard the gentleman, while the
grocer must have equally misunderstood the
lady when he entered her upon his books as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Krieg. Moreover, though the man let it be
understood that he was widely known as a
preacher, they did not at first attend service
with the rest of the community.</p>

<p>It is probable that their influence would
never have attained any hold if the old pastor
had lived. For first and last, though he was
the gentlest of men, he would none of
them. But as is the way with the gentlest as
with those most rude, he fell upon a heavy
sickness. The physician of the town was in
despair, and finally, hearing that the stranger
had a great reputation as a healer, invited
him into consultation. In this way, for the
first time, Herr Todt (if that were his name)
crossed the old pastor&#8217;s threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;We meet at last,&#8221; said the stranger.
&#8220;Aye,&#8221; said the dying man, looking him
fearlessly in the sunken eyes, &#8220;but you have
no sting for me.&#8221; &#8220;I fear,&#8221; said the stranger,
turning to the local physician, &#8220;that he is
delirious; I can do nothing.&#8221; &#8220;You have
done all you can,&#8221; cried the good old man,
&#8220;and you have failed. But oh, my flock, my
flock!&#8221; &#8220;They are in safe hands,&#8221; said the
stranger mildly. &#8220;See, rest yours in them
and feel how easy they are.&#8221; With a wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
gesture the pastor swept them away. &#8220;Retro
me, Sathanas,&#8221; he cried madly; &#8220;not into
your hands,&#8221; but, with a deep peace stealing
over him, &#8220;in tuas manus, Domine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole town attended the burial, and
in the absence of any other priest the stranger,
who, it was understood, had taken holy
orders, committed the body to the earth.
There was a profound grief for the loss of
one so simple, so friendly, so full of harmless
kindness and dreams. But more than
that, many of the older men felt that a period
had ended with their pastor&#8217;s death. &#8220;There,&#8221;
said one returning homewards, &#8220;lies old
Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this Herr Dr. Todt and his wife
moved into the presbytery, and in some way
never fully explained he became the officiating
priest. It became noticeable almost at once
that while the older men found him increasingly
distasteful, all the younger men and
most of the older women fell entirely under
his sway. Nor was this surprising, for he
preached a new and striking doctrine. In his
first sermon he took for his text, &#8220;I come to
bring, not peace, but a sword,&#8221; and for the
first time in the quiet cobbled streets there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
was a faint far-off echo of trampling steel.
He went from strength to strength, till for
those who followed him he seemed almost
more than human&mdash;almost a new Saint John,
but one who, in preparing the way for his
Lord, made it rough for all feet save His.
But yet among the older men there were those
that murmured unquietly of blasphemy and
those who said openly that he declared himself
the way of salvation, and even called
him the Antichrist. But Dr. Todt cared for
none of these things.</p>

<p>Nor was this all, for his wife began to exercise
an influence equal to, if not greater than,
her husband&#8217;s. (She had, by the way, cleared
away the muddle as to names by explaining
that she was a geborene Krieg, and had
assumed her husband&#8217;s name on marriage.)
Frau Dr. Todt continued the Sunday evening
meetings in the schoolroom, but they were
no longer a place where old men turned from
the fireside to listen to the memories of childhood.
Far from it. The talk she held was of
glory, of the old wars, and of a helmetted
god called Wotan. And it was observed that
in a strange indefinable way for those who
attended her meetings she lost her ugliness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
They swore that she was not old, nor fat,
nor a guzzler, but young and slender and
endowed with the swift feet of the Valkyries.
So fair did the young men find her that they
began even to forget their loves. But when
their sweethearts complained the young men
put them aside, saying that she was not a
rival but their mother. &#8220;Your mother!&#8221;
cried the young women, &#8220;are you mad?&#8221;
&#8220;It is only a way of speaking,&#8221; said the
young men. &#8220;She is the voice of Germany.
Have you not heard the new gospel?&#8221;
and one among them repeated the strange,
harsh lines:</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>

<p>&#8220;You are all mad together,&#8221; cried the
girls. &#8220;This means nothing. What is Wotan
to us or we to him?&#8221; &#8220;This is the new world
which we are making,&#8221; said the young men,
and returned to the feet of their teacher.</p>

<p>But there was one girl in the town who
would not give up the fight so easily. She
was the daughter of the old pastor, and for
her fairness and gentleness and soft beauty
had been called &#8220;Schneevitchen.&#8221; Like her
father before her, she had steady grey eyes,
and like him she knew the old songs of Germany
that (some said) were echoes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
song of the Niebelung&mdash;gold girls in the river
Rhine. She alone could hold her head against
the now predominant pair, and she became
in consequence the object of their deadly
hate. For often, when the young men crowded
round her, Frau Todt geborene Krieg would
look into the young men&#8217;s eyes as into a mirror
and say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="first">&#8220;Mirror, mirror on the wall,</div>
<div class="verse">am I fairest of them all?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And she would see in their eyes the shadow
of &#8220;Schneevitchen.&#8221; She and her husband
consulted together, and finally they compounded
an apple of sweet essences, which
she pretended had grown on a tree in the
Hesperides, but to her husband she confessed
that it was no such thing and that its real
name was Discord. This she gave not to
Snow-white to eat, but to the young men,
and straightway they were poisoned. For
they began to have ugly dreams and see swart
visions, and always in the dark heart of them
was Snow-white, no longer pure, gentle and
loving, but the Lorelei drawing into her
whirlpool drowning men.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>There are many tales of how she came to
perish in the broad river. Some say she
drowned herself, some say the young men,
bewildered, cast her into the waters, and
others that the strangers flung her into the
great body of the stream. None knows. But
what is known is that with her death in that
little town and in many other towns great
and small the old pastor and his daughter
were forgotten, and in their place ruled over
hearts and minds Herr Doktor Todt and his
wife, the geborene Krieg.</p>

<small>PARALLEL LINES DO NOT MEET</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THIS is quite a different sort of story.
It is about a princess who disbelieved
in arithmetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was she a French princess?&#8221; inquired
the publisher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; said the author, &#8220;and I
cannot think why you should suppose that
she was. On the contrary, she lived in Hammersmith
Broadway, and took the view that
there was no reason why parallel lines should
not meet. &#8216;Why,&#8217; she would ask, &#8216;should
they be snobs just because they happen to
be parallel? Besides,&#8217; she would add, &#8216;when
I draw them they do meet.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said a celebrated professor from
the London School of Economics who had
been summoned by her anxious parents to
cope with the situation, &#8220;those lines which
you have drawn aren&#8217;t parallel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; inquired the princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said the professor, &#8220;but it is
obvious to anybody. Can&#8217;t you see that they
meet?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the princess, &#8220;I see that,
but that is what I call being parallel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But can&#8217;t you see that you are defying
the axioms upon which all cognition is based.
If parallel lines meet, then when I meet you
you do not meet me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no harm in that,&#8221; said the princess,
who, to be perfectly honest, had formed a
(quite unjustly) low opinion of the professor&#8217;s
social gifts; &#8220;but speaking of axioms, would
you agree that God is omnipotent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said the professor, &#8220;but I
do not see how&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; said the princess icily.
&#8220;If God is omnipotent should he not be
able to draw parallel lines that meet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will forgive my observing,&#8221; said
the professor, &#8220;that if God interfered with
mathematics he would cease to be God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if mathematics interfered with
God?&#8221; inquired the princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; said the professor, slapping
his tall hat on his head with a resounding
bang, &#8220;waste my time in talking nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could, however,&#8221; cried the princess
after him, &#8220;give up teaching mathematics,
could you not?&#8221;</p>

<small>CHERCHEZ LE JUIF</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp;WILL now,&#8221; said the author, &#8220;without
more ado tell the true story of Rumpelstiltskin.
It was, I think, Professor Boxer, of
a celebrated university, who traced in it a
complete articulation of the Hittite sun-mythology.
He was not deceived by the superficial
appearance of elegant nonsense. He
observed that Rumpel (as he called him for
short), like Jahwe, laid great stress on concealing
his true name. Nor did he believe
that it was likely that even Rumpel was anything
other than a disguise. &#8216;Who?&#8217; he
effectively inquired, &#8216;would answer to such
a name?&#8217; Clearly, he concluded the name
was one of which the utterance might be
supposed to unloose the struts of the world.
Now, for my part, I cannot go the whole
way with Professor Boxer. That the story
has a deep symbolism nobody, least of all
one who makes his livelihood by the pretence,
would deny. But that it is Hittite in
origin, no one who has studied the customs
of that astounding people the Hivites would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
for a moment assert. Taking first the evidence
of the Rosetta stone, what do we find?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you have lately been on a personally
conducted tour round the British
Museum,&#8221; harshly interrupted the publisher.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I have,&#8221; cried the author, &#8220;am
I to be forbidden the simple pleasure of
showing off to my readers who have not had
a similar experience? Am I to have no
humanity, no expansion, no freedom? In
short, am I writing this book, or are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are going to take that line,&#8221; said
the publisher, &#8220;you will force me to inquire
on whom the financial risk falls? With income-tax&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the author. &#8220;As I detest
bickering, I will handle the story differently,
though I am not prepared to abandon my
Hivites.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;That damned old Jew,&#8221; began the representative
of the well-known Hittite newspaper....</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; said his Hivite colleague in the
press gallery of the Convention of the Association
of Peoples, &#8220;here he is.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>&#8220;It is my belief,&#8221; muttered the Hittite,
&#8220;that he is the authentic Wandering Jew.
He appears with his white beard and his
parcel at all international meetings. I believe
he is a plague-carrier! Good-day,&#8221; he added
aloud, &#8220;Monsieur Moses that goes always
well!&#8221;</p>

<p>The white-bearded old man deposited his
heavy parcel with a sigh. &#8220;As usual,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I find nobody to relieve me of this.&#8221;
&#8220;It would seem very heavy,&#8221; said the Hivite.
&#8220;It is very heavy,&#8221; said the old Jew; &#8220;try
to lift it.&#8221; The Hivite bent down and strained
with all his strength. The parcel shifted not
an inch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; he said, looking respectfully
at the old man. &#8220;You must be strong. But
what is it&mdash;lead or gold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The name you call the metal,&#8221; said the
old man wearily, &#8220;is a matter of taste. It is
at any rate difficult to support, in which, as
your Hittite colleague is thinking, it is not
unlike me.&#8221; &#8220;My God! what a suggestion,&#8221;
said the Hittite, whose true thought had
been accurately expressed. &#8220;But, putting on
one side your play of spirit, tell us as among
colleagues what is your object?&#8221; &#8220;To hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
over my charge to one worthy to carry it,&#8221;
said the old man. &#8220;And do you expect to
find him among this collection of international
lawmongers?&#8221; inquired the Hittite. &#8220;Where
else?&#8221; said the Jew. &#8220;Do you, then,&#8221; inquired
the Hivite, &#8220;believe in international
law?&#8221; &#8220;I sometimes pretend,&#8221; said the old
man, smilingly, &#8220;that I invented it. But
pardon me! The ceremony is about to begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hall below was filled to overflowing.
All the delegations were in their places, all
showing in their dress that the occasion was
one of a very especial character. From the
press gallery, which was behind the platform
on which the president and the officers of
the Convention sat, could be observed the
veiled statue of International Concord, which
the president was that day to dedicate. Almost
immediately that gentleman, followed by a
train, beribboned like himself, walked
solemnly on to the platform and took his seat.</p>

<p>The delegations settled down to listen to
his speech, anticipating, as they were entitled
to upon his reputation, a superb effort. But
before the president could rise to speak a
delegate from East Oceania rose to a point of
order. He was anxious to do nothing to mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the harmony of so auspicious an occasion,
but he wished to know whether any arrangements
had been made as to the order of
speeches. He represented a small country,
but one no less passionately devoted to the
cause of international concord than some of
those larger ones, owing to whose ambition
his country found itself so reduced.</p>

<p>The president rose to observe that any
delegate who desired would, if he caught his
eye, be heard. On such an occasion it would
be suitable that representatives of all classes
of nations should be heard. The representative
of West Oceania rose to inquire what
was meant by classes of nations. Was this an
indirect gibe at the smaller nations? If so, he
would observe that they had suffered enough
already at the hands of their great neighbours.
The president, who had risen to express the
hope that delegates would not indulge in
controversy, was interrupted by the delegate
from Central Oceania, who observed that on
behalf of his Government he indignantly
repudiated the calumnies that had fallen from
the lips of the last two speakers. It was owing
to the strong hand of nations such as his that
this glorious scene of international amity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was achieved. And to drive home that assertion,
let him remind the Convention that the
symbol of concord chosen, namely a griffin,
was the emblem of his State.</p>

<p>The president again endeavoured to closure
the discussion, but was forced to give way
to the delegate of the Eurasian Empire,
who said that while he entirely agreed with
the general position taken up by his Central
Oceanic colleague, he was bound to correct
him on a point of detail. The design which
had been approved by the Commission, of
which he had had the honour of acting as
chairman, was not a griffin, but the bull of
Melem-to-Pek, his country&#8217;s ensign. The
Trans-Oceanic delegate demanded the word.
Upon its being granted, he remarked that not
for the first time had the Eurasian Empire
endeavoured to confuse the issue. As the
result of what he was bound to call an unfortunate
alliance with the Hivites&mdash;contrary
to the spirit of the international tables&mdash;that
empire believed that with its ally it could
dictate to the whole world. Fortunately, however,
those who, like his country and their
friends, the Hittites, believed in internationalism
were not prepared to stand by and see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
this robber combination&mdash;&mdash; The Hivite and
Eurasian delegates leapt to their feet amid a
growing volume of cries. When order was
restored it was observed that the delegate of
Prester John had the floor. He desired simply
to observe that the symbol, for what it was
worth, was merely a dragon, the sign of the
oldest culture in the world. When the barbarians
of the West&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The tumult was renewed, and this time
the president found himself quite unable to
cope with the situation. At last a member of
the secretariat in the gallery had the brilliant
idea of tugging at the cord which suspended
the veil. As it fell a sudden hush fell on the
crowd, and then as the gold image was revealed
the cries were renewed: &#8220;The Griffin
of Central Oceania,&#8221; &#8220;The Bull of Melem-to-Pek,&#8221;
&#8220;The Gold Dragon,&#8221; &#8220;The Hesperidan
Sheep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; roared a voice of thunder.</p>

<p>All the delegates paused in utter astonishment
and looked at the press gallery, whence
this outrageous interjection had proceeded.
There they observed the old Jew standing
transfigured and terrible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fools,&#8221; he said, &#8220;do you not see that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
is a golden calf?&#8221; and with that, before anyone
could speak or interfere, he drew a shining
object from his parcel and aimed it at the
image, shattering it to fragments.</p>

<p>In a moment the whole Convention were
on their feet, shouting and cursing. A rush
was made for the gallery, but the old Jew was
not to be found. When those on the platform
examined the missile it was discovered to be
a great stone tablet inscribed with Hebrew
characters. Unfortunately there was nobody
present who knew that language. Some, however,
said that it was a rival code of honour
known among the Jews as &#8220;The Ten Points&#8221;
or &#8220;The Ten Commandments,&#8221; but others
(and these were the large majority) saw in it
only a further proof of the well-known Jewish
determination to destroy civilisation.</p>

<p>On the motion of the Philistine delegation,
it was unanimously decided to exclude the
Jews from the Association of Peoples. International
harmony having thus been restored,
the president was enabled to deliver
his speech, which, it was generally agreed,
was a magnificent contribution to the cause
of international peace and goodwill.</p>

<small>E PUR SI MUOVE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT is not easy to exaggerate the emotion
excited in the better elements in the
simian world when Bandar, the umbrella-faced
ape, announced his theory that apes
were evolved from men. It was not merely
the blasphemous suggestion that the great
Baboon had not, as inspired writing showed,
made apes in his own image. That was bad
enough, though it tended to upset the more
serious-minded rather than the general. But
what outraged the public taste and wounded
it in its tenderest point was the impudent
and indeed grossly indelicate contention that
there had been a time when monkeys had no
tails. What made it worse, however, was the
damnable plausibility of it all. Even the most
prejudiced could hardly fail to recognise
with a shudder of disgust faint far-off simian
traits, loathsomely humanised, but still distinguishable
in men. To take physique first.
It was perhaps true that the mean, chinless
face was entirely wanting in the higher bestiality.
Yet it could not be denied that men had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
been observed (notably during the recent
disturbances, when they had so continually
killed one another) with a promise of the true
prognathous chin. Then as to the withered
little arms and the long deformed lower
limbs, with their flattened pads, it could not
be disputed that in their cities the men grew
more ape-like in both respects, with arms
increasingly long and grasping and legs proportionally
short and unmanlike. It was
true that no instance had ever been known
of a man with a tail. But on the other hand,
Bandar pointed out that among certain degenerate
types of the larger ape, as for example
the Mandril, tails were far less
developed than among the better sort. Then
as to habits and manners. Here the likeness
was even more disconcerting. First, in the
matter of food, it was true that for the most
part they had the horrible human habit of
flesh-eating, but it was known that some had
so far approached the ape as to subsist on
fruit and vegetables. In the mode of life they
had the ape-like custom of crowding together.
It was true that when they did so collect they
were sufficiently unapelike to destroy all trees
and living things and to surround themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with unnatural noise and light. It must
not be forgotten, however, that those in the
highest regard (and therefore nearest to the
ape) tended not to live in such communities,
but to have large separate dwellings in whose
neighbourhood the trees and fields were left
unmolested. In the matter of marriage customs
there were, it was true, wide variations. Some
races had the human habit of several wives,
or of changing them frequently. On the other
hand, many had achieved the monkey state
of monogamy. It was unhappily true that
they were incapable of intelligent communication.
But it was perhaps not too much to
suppose that the queer discordant cries that
proceeded from their lips when several were
in company had some meaning. Finally, he
came to their settled habit of exterminating
one another for every sort of cause and lack
of cause. Here in truth they were least bestial.
But could it be urged that the apes never fell
to manlike levels in this particular?...</p>

<p>So the formidable argument continued.
A hurried Convention of Elders was summoned,
at which it was decided, first, to let it
be known that this doctrine was damnable
heresy, and secondly, to end the danger to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the simian world by the execution of the
heretic. Both decisions were duly carried out,
and both were widely applauded. But it was
like the obstinate blasphemy of Bandar to
exclaim as they slew him:</p>

<p>&#8220;E pur si muove,&#8221; by which he was understood
to mean that in so acting the apes had
behaved exactly like men.</p>

defeated, went on foot, in rags, and seemed
something of a cripple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha,&#8221; said No, &#8220;I am sorry to see you
in such case, but you will not deny that even
so I let you off lightly. I tremble to think
what vengeance you would have exacted
had you triumphed. Confess that you would
have exterminated me and not limited yourself
to ruining and crippling me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Yes reflectively, &#8220;I stand
for acceptance. I have other names, too&mdash;Love,
Hope and Charity. But as acceptance
trails your shadow of refusal, so do my other
names trail theirs&mdash;Hate, Despair and Unimaginativeness&mdash;and
the worst of these
shadows is unimaginativeness. I had dreamed,
I confess, that it would be well to wipe out
the shadows.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>&#8220;As I thought,&#8221; said No, &#8220;for all your
specious claims you are harder of heart than
I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As acceptance,&#8221; said Yes, &#8220;must always
be harder than refusal and life than death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; cried No triumphantly, &#8220;you were
wrong. Here go you in rags for all your lights,
and here ride I in purple for all my shadows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wrong,&#8221; said Yes, &#8220;because I was
young. I did not see that I must accept you
and your shadows with the rest. I was fighting
not against you but against myself when
I would not accept as part of myself the great
refusal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried No, deeply mortified
and inwardly afraid, &#8220;beggar that you are,
do you dare to claim that you have won?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only know,&#8221; said Yes gently, &#8220;that
there is no victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You canting hypocrite,&#8221; cried No, &#8220;you
do not know how to take a licking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is because I do,&#8221; said Yes, &#8220;that there
cannot be victory or defeat. For if the fight
were ended where would you be, where I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something in that,&#8221; said No
disconsolately; &#8220;but if it be true, why should
you fight? Let us make an eternal peace!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>&#8220;That would be to refuse,&#8221; said Yes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn you,&#8221; cried No, &#8220;I will have
peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes two,&#8221; said Yes gently, &#8220;to make
a peace,&#8221; and turned to limp away.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Yes,&#8221; cried No after him, now
thoroughly dismayed, &#8220;how is all this to
end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear No,&#8221; said Yes, &#8220;it does not end.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">DOWN a path in the wood she came
singing. The path on which she walked
was itself like a song under leaves like music.
The path was the echo of the song, or the
song of the path. It does not matter. This
was before music and the world made of
music had fallen apart.</p>

<p>His shadow fell on the path. The song
stopped; the path grew still.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quiet, quiet,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is love,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something has died,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And has risen from the dead,&#8221; he cried,
drawing very close. &#8220;Love has conquered
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas,&#8221; she said, taking his hand and kissing
it, &#8220;before love came there was no death
to conquer.&#8221;</p>
